She explained that wasn't the case: "(NOT CLOSING DOWN. Just restructuring of business to a personal training studio….No more group classes. No longer need all this small equipment.”</p><p>Tamra is very passionate about working out and living a healthy lifestyle. She changed her body in 2016 and shared in an interview with&nbsp;Entertainment&nbsp;Tonight, "I truly believe that working out, eating well, and taking your supplements is really the key to staying young," she shares with ET. "I can see it in my face. I can see it in my skin. I can just see it in my whole body. You know, I'm 48 years old."</p><p>Tamra also entered a fitness competition and won. She told Bravotv.com&nbsp;that&nbsp;she was exercising two to three hours daily and she went very low-carb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="'RHOC': Is Elizabeth Vargas Still The Richest Housewife?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'RHOC': Is Elizabeth Vargas Still The Richest Housewife?</a></span></p><h2 id=tamra-s-other-company>Tamra's Other Company</h2><p>Tamra also has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBD company called Vena Wellness</a>. According to&nbsp;Page Six, she said she chose the name because Eddie&nbsp;has a heart condition called Vena Cava. The company sells products such as a CBD Oil Tincture, CBD Gel Capsules, and CBD Cooling Cream.</p><p>Tamra explained,&nbsp;"It is 100% our company. In fact, Vena comes from Eddie’s heart condition. Vena Cava is the full name. And basically, the vena cava is the two major banks that drive blood into your heart. So that’s why we’re very heart-driven.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="'RHONJ': Jennifer Aydin's $3 Million Mansion Has More Than Just 16 Bathrooms" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'RHONJ': Jennifer Aydin's $3 Million Mansion Has More Than Just 16 Bathrooms</a></span></p><p>Once the news was out that Tamra wasn't returning to&nbsp;RHOC, she shared that her ex-husband, Simon Barney, had stage 3 throat cancer. According to&nbsp;Bravotv.com, she said,&nbsp;"I was going to say I wasn't coming back at the reunion. I had just found out about Simon days before the reunion. I was a mess. I had been crying." She said people asked what was going on and she felt that it was too hard to be there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of Simon's health and Eddie's heart condition, Tamra realized that it was time to leave the series. She told&nbsp;People, "it’s just very hard for me to want to go on a show where people are screaming and yelling and arguing about things that don’t even matter. They’ve taught me that life is precious, and you don’t get that time back.”</p><p>With a $2 million net worth, a great marriage to Eddie, and her many business ventures, it looks like Tamra Judge is doing really well. Of course, fans will always miss seeing her on&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Orange County, and it would be amazing if she ever did decide to return, even just for a brief visit.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranking The Seasons Of ‘RHOBH’ Based On How Many Viewers Their Premieres Had</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqa6uvsBmoa6cl5p6ornArKqenF2dsrN5kWakoqScnryvec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jet-crashes-during-thunder-over-michigan-air-show-wsoc-tv.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jet crashes during Thunder Over Michigan air show WSOC TV</a>
