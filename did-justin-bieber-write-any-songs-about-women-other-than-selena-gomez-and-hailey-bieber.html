News reported that Justin Bieber might have written his song "Never Let You Go" about Beadles.</p><p>The song didn't hit number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was number 21, but that's still pretty good considering how many pop songs are released all the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/caitlin-beadles.jpg><p>According to E! News, Bieber and Beadles were in a relationship from 2008 to 2019. The publication reported that they split up as Bieber was becoming more well-known and that took its toll. Of course, they were both young at the time. It would have been tough to keep dating even if Bieber wasn't becoming a huge pop star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Many Justin Bieber Songs Are About Selena Gomez And Wife Hailey Bieber?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Never Let You Go" is definitely a romantic song. It was released in 2010 and features lyrics like "And when you hold my hand/Then I understand that it's meant to be/'Cause baby, when you're with me/It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven."</p><p>While those lyrics are absolutely cheesy, they were reminiscent of Justin Bieber's brand at the time. He sang pop songs that made his fanbase swoon. And now that he has gotten older, he still sings romantic songs. But, of course, his more recent music is about his wife Hailey Bieber.</p><p>Today, Caitlin Beadles has over 300,000 followers on Instagram and started a business called Caitlin’s Vine Of Bravery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/caitlin-beadles-beach.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, People reported that Beadles and Christian, her brother, went to Hailey and Justin Bieber's wedding in South Carolina. It seems that there were no hard feelings after their break-up because they stayed in contact with each other. This was the second wedding for the Biebers as they had previously tied the knot in 2018.</p><h2 id=did-justin-bieber-write-a-song-about-sofia-richie>Did Justin Bieber Write A Song About Sofia Richie?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber and Sofia Richie dated</a> for a period of six weeks, according to People.

And in 2022, he said about being married to Hailey Bieber, "being inspired by my relationship has definitely produced some great music," according to Yahoo! Fans would absolutely agree with that statement because Bieber keeps releasing fun songs. His last two albums, "Changes" and "Justice," are just as good as his previous ones.</p><h2 id=did-justin-bieber-write-any-songs-about-his-ex-girlfriend-jasmine-villegas>Did Justin Bieber Write Any Songs About His Ex-Girlfriend Jasmine Villegas?</h2><p>While Justin Bieber has been linked to a few women, his other confirmed romance was with Jasmine Villegas.</p><p>Villegas starred in Bieber's "Baby" music video.

She said, “Our close friends knew for sure, but he was in his prime and his core fans were girls so we couldn’t go out in public. We couldn’t have a boyfriend/girlfriend type of [relationship] and personally for me I felt like he was the star and I was the opener. We dated for the first half of the second leg and then actually broke up while on tour."</p><p>While Justin Bieber stayed pals with Caitlin Beades, he and Jasmine Villegas might not have stayed in touch. Villegas is a singer who put out two EPS, "That's Me Right There" and "No Judgement" in 2014 and 2019. She now has two children, a daughter named Mizo and a son named Zayne, according to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn8K0wMinZJuhlZeys3nWq6CtnV2ovK%2Bz0maYm6elqXq4u8yepWanpJ2ys3nToZinZaOauaa6wGaeqKWVr3qprcilnLJlkp6yo7HRaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dr-phil-s-sister-in-law-dies-at-age-68.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dr. Phil's Sister In Law Dies At Age 68</a>
