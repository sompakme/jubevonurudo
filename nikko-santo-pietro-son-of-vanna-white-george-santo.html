When Nikko was young, he lived in Santo Pietro with his parents and younger sister, Gigi.</p><p>Andrea Santo Pietro is Nikko’s older half-sister. George Santo Pietro’s first wife, Linda Evans, gave birth to their daughter.</p><p>Her mother’s secrecy about his upbringing led to a secluded upbringing. However, most of what is known about his early life comes from internet sources alone.</p><p>After twelve years of marriage, Nikko’s parents decided to divorce, and they tied the knot in December of 1990. However, the media has yet to report on the reason behind the split.</p><p>As of 2022, It is hard to believe that this young and gifted guy is now 28 years old because he still appears much more youthful than other people of his generation.</p><p>Nikko Santo Pietro has the nationality of the United States of America and was born under the zodiac sign of Gemini.</p><p>Nikko Santo Pietro first attended Oregon State University, where he majored in Agriculture Science.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating from OSU, he continued his education at the University of Arizona, where he received his doctorate.</p><p>Nikko keeps himself physically fit by going on long hikes many times a month, playing a wide variety of sports with his friends, attending the gym twice a week, and adhering to a rigorous diet.</p><p>He has volunteered several times at a shelter for abused and abandoned animals due to his compassion for their plight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Height, Weight & Physical Appearance</h2><p>He is a tall individual who has not disclosed his height or weight.&nbsp;</p><p>He also has not provided any information regarding his bodily measurements, including his breast, waist, or hip size.&nbsp;</p><p>He possesses striking brown eyes and jet black hair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Social Media Presence: Is He An Active User?</h2><p>Nikko Santo Pietro is active on social media platforms such as Instagram and <a href=#>Facebook</a> and has amassed many followers on each platform.

His parents, George Santo Pietro, a restaurateur, and Vanna, a homemaker, sealed the marriage in December 1990. Speculation about a&nbsp;romantic relationship between them dates back to 1985.</p><p>The couple had been married for twelve years when they finally divorced. The couple finalized their divorce in November 2002 and went in different directions.</p><p>George is married to TV producer, hotelier, and real estate developer Melissa Mascari, while Vanna is seriously involved with his boyfriend, John Donaldson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nikko Santo Pietro Net Worth</h2><p>Some reports on the internet state that he has not disclosed his net worth, while other sources assert that it is roughly $300,000 and will increase due to additional strenuous work and initiatives.</p><p>While Nikko’s exact <a href=#>wealth</a> remains unknown, it’s been speculated to be in the $300,000.
