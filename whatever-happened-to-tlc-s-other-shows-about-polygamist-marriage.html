As one of the country's most popular broadcasting networks, the entertainment channel regularly pulls in millions of viewers from across the globe, all of whom are primed and ready for their dose of action-packed drama. Some fan favorites include 90 Day Fiancé, MILF Manor, Say Yes To The Dress, Dr Pimple Popper, and of course, Sister Wives, just to name a few. These shows are all highly popular among fans and have become a go-to for many who want to kick back and relax, all while divulging themselves in the lives of those on-screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the channel's most popular shows Sister Wives often racks in hundreds of thousands, if not millions of viewers. For the show's Season 11 premiere, over 2 million fans tuned in, with the numbers being reflective of its immense popularity. Not only does this show that viewers actively enjoy watching how others navigate the world of polygamous relationships, but it also shows just how successful the show has become since it first aired in 2010. With polygamous shows clearly driving such high viewership numbers, it seems logical that TLC would naturally want to include more. So, what exactly does the popular broadcasting network have lined up for the future?</p><h2 id=tlc-has-already-launched-two-highly-successful-shows-about-polygamous-relationships>TLC Has Already Launched Two Highly Successful Shows About Polygamous Relationships</h2><p>Already, TLC has released two highly successful shows that revolve around the world of polygamy. The first, Sister Wives, first aired in 2010 and has since gone on to become one of the network's most popular shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the show is based on polygamy, the show takes a look into the lives of Kody Brown and his wives, who live their lives as part of a 'polygamous marriage'.</p><p>Of course, this comes with its own set of rules and challenges, and fans are treated to an inside look into the world of polygamy, watching as Kody and his wives try to navigate through their relationship together.</p><p>However, there have been plenty of instances where the wives have been involved in plenty of drama. One example of this is when <a href=#>Kody and his wives seemed to want to isolate Meri</a>. Eventually, all but Kody's wife Robyn split from their polygamist husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sisters Wives isn't the only successful show based on polygamy that the broadcasting network has launched. In 2018, the broadcasting network launched <a href=#>Seeking Sister Wife</a>, a show which focuses on showcasing three different families who are all at different stages of a polygamous relationship. Similarly to Sisters Wives, the show is filled with plenty of drama-filled episodes that are particularly appealing to fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="This Is What The Brown Family On ‘Sister Wives’ Really Thinks About Each Other">This Is What The Brown Family On ‘Sister Wives’ Really Thinks About Each Other</a></span></p><p>Since its release, the show has grown to become immensely popular although not on par with Sister Wives. Often, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show pulls in hundreds of thousands of viewers</a>, which according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parrot Analytics</a>, is higher than the industry average.</p><p>However, the broadcasting network has also aired other polygamy-based shows that ended up being canceled. So, which shows didn't quite appeal to fans as much as originally hoped?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, TLC launched My Five Wives, a show that would follow Brady Williams and his five wives navigating through the world of polygamy while judgmental eyes bore in on their relationship. However, the show was canceled after two seasons and officially wrapped up in 2014.</p><p>Despite this, it seems as though TLC has a new show about polygamy brewing in the pipeline, and it seems as though fans are excited.</p><h2 id=seeking-brother-husband-is-still-going-ahead-and-was-announced-in-2023>Seeking Brother Husband Is Still Going Ahead, And Was Announced In 2023</h2><p>A new show, named Seeking Brother Husband was announced with a launch scheduled in March 2023. Much like Sister Wives and the channel's other polygamy-based shows, the new show will have several polygamous couples, who each have their own thoughts and feelings on the matter.</p><p>However, this show will differ slightly, in the sense that it will be the women with several husbands, rather than the men. This new angle allows for a new and fresh perspective for viewers to soak up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar46060791-1.jpg><p>The channel trailer seemed to stir up excitement among fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with many gathering in Reddit threads to discuss their thoughts</a>.</p><p>One fan commented: "This is gonna be so much fun to watch!
