O'Brien released a book titled "TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald". While Trump often seems to believe that all publicity is good publicity, it certainly seems clear he didn't feel that way about this book. After all, he sued O'Brien for $5 billion over his book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/timothy-l-o-brien-being-interviewed.jpg><p>From the moment that Trump rose to fame, there has been a lot of discussion about how rich Trump really is.</p><p>How rich is Donald Trump?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How rich did Forbes say Donald Trump was</a> as of September 2023?</p></td><td><p>$2.6 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How rich does Celebrity Net Worth say Donald Trump is</a> as of January 2024?</p></td><td><p>$2.8 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How rich did Donald Trump say he was in June 2014</a>?</p></td><td><p>$8.7 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How rich did Donald Trump's campaign say he was</a> in July 2014?</p></td><td><p>Over $10 billion</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These days, the biggest financial publications report that Trump is worth more than $2 billion. However, when O'Brien released "TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald" in 2005, he estimated that Trump was worth between $150 million and $250 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/did-any-of-ivana-trump-s-spouses-get-along-with-her-second-husband-donald-trump_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Any Of Ivana Trump's Spouses Get Along With Her Second Husband, Donald Trump?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The former President Donald Trump's relationships with Iavana Trump's other three husbands are fascinating.</span><p>When O'Brien released his book with that estimate, he had to know that would outrage Trump. In fact, since O'Brien wrote about Trump's past behavior, he should have anticipated that he may need to defend himself against the business leader in court.</p><p>That said, it seems all but certain that nobody would have anticipated how much money Trump wound up suing the author for. In 2009, Trump sued O'Brien for defamation, and he asked for a staggering sum of $5 billion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-3.png><p>Unfortunately for Trump, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a judge ultimately threw out his $5 billion lawsuit</a>. That said, it is important to note that the court throwing out the lawsuit doesn't mean that they deemed O'Brien's reporting on Trump's fortune to be accurate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead, the court revealed in a ruling that they couldn't find that O'Brien acted with malice while writing about Trump's fortune.</p><p>âThere were no significant internal inconsistencies in the information provided by the confidential sources, nor was there âreliableâ information that contradicted their reports, so as to provide evidence of actual malice. Nothing suggests that OâBrien was subjectively aware of the falsity of his sourceâs figures or that he had actual doubts as to the informationâs accuracy.â</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/was-king-charles-relationship-with-donald-trump-complicated-by-the-former-president-aggressively-flirting-with-princess-diana_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Was King Charles And Donald Trump's Relationship Complicated By The Former President 'Aggressively' Flirting With Princess Diana?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Donald Trump reportedly "aggressively" tried to romance Princess Diana after she got divorced from King Charles</span><p>While Trump had to be upset to have his lawsuit thrown out, things got worse from there. The reason for that is a relic from Trump's failed lawsuit against O'Brien has since been consistently used against the former President by his detractors.</p><p>Even now that it has been close to two decades since O'Brien published his book, there is still a lot of debate over how rich Trump is. In many cases, that is because Trump's detractors routinely argue that Trump isn't as wealthy as he or publications like Forbes claim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it is nothing new for people to claim that the leaders of opposing political parties are liars.

While O'Brien's team questioned Trump, the former President stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he raises and lowers his claims about his net worth based on his own feelings</a>. That quote has been routinely wielded to question any reports about Trump's net worth ever since.</p><p>Obviously aware that many people question how rich Donald Trump is, Forbes published an article on the subject in December 2022. That piece that backed up claims that Trump is very rich was titled " <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes, Trump Is Still A Billionaire (Even Though He Paid So Little In Taxes)</a> ".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>âYes, even my own feelings, as to where the world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day.

Then you have a year later, and the city is as hot as a pistol. Even months after that it was a different feeling. So yeah, even my own feelings affect my value to myself.â</p><h2 id=an-author-was-happy-donald-trump-sued-him-for-5-billion>An Author Was Happy Donald Trump Sued Him For $5 Billion</h2><p>In the world, millions of people live from check to check, and much worse. For those people, the idea of being sued for billions is crazy to even fathom. After all, even if a court ruled those people owed a fraction of $5 billion, their finances would be destroyed forever. With that in mind, it is wild that an author was happy that Donald Trump sued them for a staggering amount of money.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_donald-trump-jr-embraced-being-continuously-booed-at-his-book-launch_bk_a2-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Donald Trump Jr. Embraced Being Continuously Booed At His Book Launch</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Donald Trump Jr.'s reaction to being heckled at a book signing garnered headlines all over the world.</span><p>In February 2016, The National Review published an article about Trump's history of suing people. For that piece, they spoke to Timothy L. O'Brien about Trump suing him for $5 billion. According to what O'Brien told the publication, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was happy about Trump's eye-catching lawsuit against him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>âI was happy to go to court with him over this one.

After all, it seems like O'Brien would have to hate Trump to be willing to risk a fortune to defeat him in court. However, O'Brien actually spoke to The National Review about what he liked about Trump. O'Brien did go on to call Trump out after that, however.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What are Donald Trump's weirdest lawsuits</a>, according to Fortune?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Trump sues Julius and Edmond Trump</strong></li><li><strong>Trump sues Merv Griffin</strong></li><li><strong>Trump sues a Miss USA contestant</strong></li><li><strong>Trump sues Ivana Trump</strong></li><li><strong>Trump sues The Chicago Tribune</strong></li></ul><p>âThis will sound weird, but there are parts of him that I really like.
