We have to give the men and women who do it a lot of credit. We have to be willing to not only understand the difficulty but how hard it is to even get an acting job. You have to have the right look, voice, age, hair, etc. It can be absolutely crazy how much casting directors look for. From the how hard it is to get work to how hard it is to keep it, this job is clearly one of toughest to continue doing for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This has led to people cutting corners. Some in the entertainment industry have used drugs like steroids in order to properly get in the right shape for a part. Others make sure to get close to certain casting directors or directors period, which allows them to get work after they do another "job" for them. No matter who they are, or what they do, people go above and beyond at times to get work initially.</p><p>Is it odd that people do this? No. If you want to get ahead, at times you must cut corners and do some shady things. While it is clearly not asked, it is heavily implied that if you do some shady stuff...it can work quite well. Other times, it backfires massively. It truly depends on the circumstances at the end of the day. Some know the right person or may actually be married to them. There are multiple ways where we could see someone get a job over someone else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While most assume actresses get a job in some sort of shady way, it is actually quite common for men to do the exact same thing. In this list, we highlight both and what they did that made the world consider their actions to be shady. We'll even point to the issue of their acting versus someone else who might have been up for the same part. We hope you enjoy our 15 celebs who got the job in shady ways....even though they cannot act.</p><h2 id=the-kardashians><strong>The Kardashians</strong></h2><p>No list would be complete regarding actors or actresses getting roles they don't deserve without bringing up someone from reality television. We could not possibly ignore the Queens of Reality TV, The Kardashians...could we? Of course not! So the story goes that Kim Kardashian was in a relationship with actor/music artist, Ray J, and we all know what they filmed. This tape would randomly get released to the internet and start a huge desire for Kim to be seen in the mainstream. It was later revealed that her own mother, Kris Jenner, <a href=#>released the tape herself</a>. Kris has even confirmed this! Seriously, mother of the year people!&nbsp;The move paid off, and the entire family benefitted. Especially Kris and Kim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The entire Kardashian family would get their own Reality TV series called Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which became a massive hit for the E! Network. The family has had some success that led to opening businesses as well as Kim pretty much making a living off her Twitter account. For those unaware, Reality TV is scripted too. There is very little reality involved, which might be shocking to some...but it's completely true. The Kardashians landed a job because Kim had a tape of her getting it on with a D-List celebrity.</p><p>Seriously, this actually happened and yet people still love this family. We've heard of celebs sleeping their way to the top, but this has never been more obvious than with the Kardashian clan. (Source: USMagazine)</p><h2 id=chelsea-handler><strong>Chelsea Handler</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chelsea Handler is most known for her talk shows that have been on E! and now Netflix. She was considered to be a very funny comedian, but her biggest issue was that she had trouble getting hired for work here and there. She was not a great actress, but still quite funny. This allowed her to do well in stand-up and on various talk show appearances, but she never truly excelled in the movie or TV world when it came to completely acting. Her best work came when she was just being herself. Though this did take some sort of acting, despite the talk-show vibe in all of it.</p><p>Apparently, Chelsea was not the best of friends with the late Joan Rivers. While Joan was older and not caring later in her career, she would often let out stuff that many had to wonder about. Basically, Rivers claims that Handler became very friendly with whoever was at the top of the food chain. Just to get the spot on E! she would need to do this, according to Joan. Chelsea would be asked about it and say she does not care what Rivers said. But she did not seem to deny it really.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Handler herself admitted to <a href=#>having a relationship </a>with the CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, Ted Harbert. She claimed it did help her career out as well, so it would not be shocking if Rivers was telling the truth. Either way, Handler does not seem to be refuting much of it. (Source: HollywoodReporter)</p><h2 id=marilyn-monroe><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong></h2><p>Marilyn Monroe was mostly known for her modeling roles before getting involved in any sort of television or movie role. While casting agents and producers would cast Monroe mostly on her looks alone, there were plenty of amazing young actresses who were stunning as well. There is no need to go to the modeling world to find someone for a role, right? In this time, they had legendary women. The 40's-70's saw some of the best actresses in history and we continue to see great ones today. You don't need a model unless you "want" a model. That is where Monroe came into play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monroe loved modeling, but she loved fame seemingly more than anything. It's no surprise that she had a very public relationship with New York Yankees star Joe DiMaggio and even a rumoured&nbsp;relationship with U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Monroe, sadly, was not the best actress, however. She would be hired on looks alone, but one has to wonder why. Again, there were many beautiful women available. The reason she was hired was due to what she would do for a part.</p><p>Monroe <a href=#>openly admitted</a> to giving favors to people in order to get hired for movie roles. It is uncertain how long she went about doing this. When word spreads that someone is willing to do something, other people will bring them in and see what they can do too. As a result, this happened often in early and even recent Hollywood. It's no surprise that Monroe did this. The shady part is, it likely took a job away from a better actress. (Source: DailyMail)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox><strong>Megan Fox</strong></h2><p>It is uncertain if we can truly blame Megan Fox for this situation, but we sort of can it seems. Years ago, Megan Fox truly got her start in the Transformers movie franchise. Michael Bay was the director of the films and brought his crazy vision to life on the screen. However, he needed to cast a gorgeous girl to play a very critical role in the series. Megan Fox was one of many girls to audition for the role. However, Fox likely went <a href=#>above and beyond</a> for the job.</p><p>Fox spoke out on Bay, mostly regarding his directing saying he was terrible to work with. Ultimately, this altercation would result in Fox leaving the Transformers movies and another woman to come in to play the next romantic lead. A whole new cast has been used in the recent movies as well. Despite the falling out with Bay, the two got together again on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie franchise, where Fox plays the April O'Neill character. It seems she was fine with how she got the first big movie role and it seems Bay has been more than happy to cast her in his stuff ever since. (Source: AutoBlog)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=channing-tatum><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></h2><p>Channing Tatum has become quite a major Hollywood name over the years. His impressive dancing ability helped him land in the movie franchise Step-Up, and he's likely made every girl pass out at least once with the Magic Mike movies. However, before Tatum ever made it in Hollywood...he was sort of weirdly scouted. Tatum needed money relatively bad and knew his dancing was above average. He had a good body as well, which resulted in Tatum going into&nbsp;the same business from his films.</p><p>No surprise,&nbsp;a scout who saw him one night helped Tatum land a role in a random music video and other roles would be his shortly after. While today Tatum is not a bad actor, he was not initially the best to see. His early acting work was subpar at best because he was not there to be an amazing dramatic actor. He was there mostly due to his athletic and dancing ability. It's quite odd that Tatum would be scouted in such a way, and somehow make it to where he is today. We're pretty sure dancing did not totally seal the deal initially. But you never know these days. (Source: Glamour)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leah-remini><strong>Leah Remini</strong></h2><p>Leah Remini was a major fixture on television for years when she starred alongside Kevin James in the hit series The King of Queens. The show ran for a long period of time before ending after James suddenly began to get a nice movie career. James would decide to go back to television with the series Kevin Can Wait, which has been a relatively good success. However, due to his connection to Remini on the program, James would invite her to be a guest star on the show. Eventually, she would land a bigger role. The weird part? Kevin's character was already married to another woman on the show, who was well-liked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Erinn Hayes would play his wife in the initial first season, but by the next, she was fired from the show. Due to having a bigger connection to James, Leah would replace her. The idea for the show was that Kevin's wife would suddenly die and eventually Leah would get closer to James and the two would sort of have another King of Queens going on. James felt a better connection to Leah, so it's no surprise he pushed for the firing of his on-screen wife to replace her with his other on-screen wife. Most believe Leah pushed for this and now has a huge part on the show as a result. It seems pretty easy to believe as well. (Source: Variety)</p><h2 id=paris-hilton><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's a weird situation when it comes to someone like Paris Hilton. She is an heiress to the infamous Hilton Hotel franchise and grew up literally with a gold spoon in her mouth. She had nothing to worry about and there was nothing that she could not have. It would seem odd for her to want for something so bad that she would go about it in a negative way. Why do so, right? Apparently not, as Hilton got famous in the same way Kim K did. On top of this, she used her fame, money, and heiress ability to force her hand in Hollywood. She is a horrible actress, but she made it in Hollywood somehow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She would appear in the movie House of Wax and easily make her way into reality television. The thought is that Paris pretty much had whatever she wanted and played the rich girl you could not say no to. As a result, she became impossible to ignore. Her fame when dating famous men, or those <a href=#>with famous connections</a>, would help her as well. She still does all she can to get talked about in the media. (Source: GaloreMag)</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><strong>Jessica Alba</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Jessica Alba is normally seen as a person who could be considered a great overall human being, good mom, and good wife...she didn't always have that reputation. Years ago, Jessica Alba knew what every Hollywood actress knew. If you wanted to get into movies, and <a href=#>Harvey Weinstein</a> had a part available...you could get close. Perhaps the closer you got to him, the more likely you were to get a part in one of the movies his studio had available.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alba starred in Awake, a movie under the Harvey studio banner that helped Alba gain momentum in Hollywood. Alba was relatively known before, but after 2007 she would land some pretty nice roles. In fact, the very same year she had some major hits. By the time 2008, she was off and rolling and a major force in the world of Hollywood. While her true start was years prior and she had some good roles before, it seems that her role in Awake ultimately did a lot for her career. Combine that with her other work, with the influence Weinstein had this time...and you're seeing a weird situation play out. (Source: NickiSwift)</p><h2 id=rose-mcgowan><strong>Rose McGowan</strong></h2><p>While Rose McGowan has carved out a relatively good career for herself in Hollywood today, she has been the center of controversy over the years. She too had an issue with Harvey Weinstein, and when women started to come forward with issues that had with him, she joined in. Rose clearly saw a bump in Hollywood after this. However, the $100,000 payoff was a nice start to things for her. Though Rose was by no means someone who could complain about using someone for personal gain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the Weinstein Company released the Grindhouse movies but they were directed by Robert Rodriquez. Rose was already with Rodriquez that many believe led to her getting her part in the movies, to begin with. (Source: TheBlemish)</p><h2 id=farrah-abraham><strong>Farrah Abraham</strong></h2><p>If you have not caught up to the story yet, reality television stars are not always the most well-adjusted people in the world. We all know how she got famous, and as a result of it, it landed her on the hit MTV series 16 & Pregnant as a result. Her popularity on the show led to her being used in the other hit MTV series, Teen Mom. While the network did popularize the idea that these girls not only had relations young, but it glorified the very act. Abraham was addicted to the spotlight more than most as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there is anything reality TV producers love more than the programming they create, it's real-life drama. Farrah is full of it, and that is excellent for the camera. Her decision to release a tape for a huge sum is understandable, but after a nice stint on MTV...she did not so much need the money as need the spotlight. This led to her decision, and why to this day we're seeing her on television.</p><h2 id=rita-ora><strong>Rita Ora</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's interesting to see what goes down when aspiring musical artists/actors and reality television stars randomly begin dating. <a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a> had dated music artist Rita Ora for a while, but the relationship would randomly end. Ora began getting bigger opportunities in her music and in Hollywood around the same time.&nbsp; Rob went to Twitter to claim that Rita had&nbsp;been with at least 20 people to get to where she was in her career. Ora has had some relatively good success in music, and while it may have taken a bit of her own "certain ability" to get a recording deal...her music did not lie. She did that on her own. That does not mean studio heads are willing to hire her for a part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Rita has been seen in the Fifty Shades movie franchise. Which is pretty hilarious when you think about it. She'd also appear in Southpaw. It is assumed she likely did&nbsp;something with someone in a high ranking position to get her spot on the Fifty Shades movie originally. However, she did do well with the part and her career continued to rise. Being in a public relationship with a Kardashian did not hurt her in the public eye either, as many in America did not know her before this.</p><h2 id=kendra-wilkinson><strong>Kendra Wilkinson&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Kendra Wilkinson started her career in television on the show The Girls Next Door. The show follows around the three Hugh Hefner girlfriends, as well as Hefner himself. The trio were quite entertaining and thus E! kept the show going for a while. Hefner, of course, owned the infamous Playboy Magazine. His magazine is, of course, well-known and part of legend by now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to the fact that Kendra was 18 at the time of meeting Hefner, the idea of being around him and his home was clearly huge for her. They met as she posed at one of his parties as a painted lady. Kendra would join the UK I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! and tell us what happened and why she decided to become a girlfriend of Hugh's. She would claim:</p><p>"He asked me to be one of his girlfriends and I was like I don’t know what that means but hell yeah I’m there. I was living in the smallest apartment and I was praying for anything to get me out of there".</p><h2 id=gretchen-mol><strong>Gretchen Mol</strong></h2><p>Perhaps one of the most infamous examples of Harvey Weinstein's reach was seen with Gretchen Mol. She would become a very popular young actress years ago when associated with Harvey. He helped to land her on the cover of Vanity Fair. Due to the heavily noticed magazine and the backing by a notable Hollywood figure, Mol would start to rise in fame. Harvey was even nice enough&nbsp;to pay for her apartment for THREE YEARS! Suddenly her star fell massively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mol would <a href=#>refute any claims</a> that Harvey&nbsp;wronged her, however. She'd claim that he never had relations with her either, or even as much as be in a room alone with the man. However, the proof is pretty apparent that something happened between Weinstein and Gretchen Mol. The reason for this knowledge is due to the various stories he told his friends about his relations with Mol.</p><p>To have enough to pay for <a href=#>an expensive apartment</a> when Mol was getting smaller parts in Hollywood does seem fishy. Especially if nothing was going on with the two. This is why many think there was something, at least for a while. For Harvey to do so much for one girl would be odd, knowing his history in Hollywood. Mol's star fell hard, and though things did improve for her....it did not go perfectly. A connection to Harvey made sense.

To this day, his legendary reputation has allowed him to have a factor no one can teach. Dean realized that if he could make himself come off a certain way, it could be considered cool or desirable. Before Fonzie in Happy Days, James Dean was the man looked at as the desirable heartthrob that men wanted to be and women wanted to be with. James Dean's biography titled Tomorrow Never Comes would speak on Dean and his connections to Hollywood, recounting how he did what he had to in order to get and even keep work. Author of the book, Darwin Porter, claimed:</p><p>“He had three or four conquests each week and though he wasn’t the most handsome man, didn’t have a great body, had two false front teeth, and was often rude, women and men threw themselves at him. But despite all his success he remained a tormented soul and never escaped his inner demons.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James Dean was connected to several legendary women in Hollywood like Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford. But it's also rumored he had some experiences with male actors as well, like Rock Hudson and Marlon Brando. We're serious there. The flings with men and women led to Dean continuing to land roles in Hollywood. Though his looks and ability often got him the role anyway, he'd seal most of these roles with the confirmation. Dean would pass away at a relatively young age due to a car accident. (Source: Express)</p><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></h2><p>Gwyneth Paltrow has made a major career happen for herself in the world of Hollywood as of late. However,&nbsp;her career was not always sunshine and rainbows. She would be a struggling actress like many. Due to this, she would need to do pretty much anything to get the top. The issue is that some men and women cannot get even as much as an audition for roles at times. Paltrow would need to, at the very least, manage to get THIS opportunity. Harvey Weinstein was a powerful producer in the 90's and gave many opportunities to both actors and actresses alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gwyneth&nbsp;did what she had to do with him in order to get the part in Shakespeare in Love. The role earned her an Academy Award, which kickstarted her career in Hollywood in a major way. Though she had some success before, this ultimately helped her big time. Yet it wasn't as if she was the best young actress for the part. <a href=#>Decider Reporter</a> Olivia Armstrong would write a major report on Paltrow and Weinstein, claiming:</p><p>"Paltrow was the Weinsteins’ It Girl back in 1995, right after Se7en put her on the map and just before The Pallbearer and Emma — the latter earning her the top-billing spot two years later in Miramax’s first Best Picture-winner, Shakespeare in Love, beating Steven Spielberg’s war epic, Saving Private Ryan, which, to this day, is still a shock. Paltrow was The Weinsteins’ most promising money-maker, and if there’s anything Harvey Weinstein loves more than editing films to death, it’s money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She would go on to say that Paltrow was spoken about by Harvey all the time to directors and producers after this. Which in theory would allow Harvey to make more money through her, but would also allow him to take some advantage. At least early on, he had it big time. As her star would rise she would get away from any real association.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6pLHLnpmsZaedvG6vwK6eoaxdqbWmtdFmmaKfXZe%2Fpq3KaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bill-wyman-net-worth-therichest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bill Wyman Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
