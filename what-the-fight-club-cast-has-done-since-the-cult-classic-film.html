While the 1999 film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's book of the same name was a box office failure, it's become <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the greatest cult classics of our generation</a>, and its success could never be replicated. It stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto, Zach Grenier, Holt McCallany, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Passed On A $2 Million Role To Play This Iconic Comic Book Character</a></span></p><p>It's been over two decades since Fight Club hit the cinema, and all of its cast members have ventured into other things in life. Some, like <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong>, have continued to make it big in Hollywood, while others are not doing so good with roles after Fight Club. Here's what the cult classic Fight Club cast has done since the film, and what's next for them in the future.</p><h2 id=holt-mccallany><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Holt McCallany</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holt McCallany may not be a big Hollywood name like his Fight Club co-stars, but he's currently breaking hearts and solving mysteries in <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>'s psychological thriller Mindhunter. The Men of Honor actor portrays real-lief special agent Bill Tench, solving one murder case to another in the 1970s and the 1980s. The series currently has two seasons in the disposal and an upcoming season three on its way, but showrunners have been postponing it for quite some time since 2020.</p><p>"I wanted to have an experience that approximates Bill Tench’s experience," the actor told The Hollywood Reporter of visiting real killers to prepare for the role. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I wanted to understand what my guy was feeling</a> when he went into these places and had these interactions."</p><h2 id=zach-grenier><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Zach Grenier</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zach Grenier found success in television shortly after Fight Club.

He's a capable actor who keeps the same level of work in his music, having served as the frontman of his rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. The formation, founded by the Leto brothers, has released five chart-hitting studio albums, and is now gearing up for the upcoming sixth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of his acting film, the multi-instrumentalist method actor has found more success throughout the decades. His latest film, House of Gucci, was somewhat polarizing, but it gained him a plethora of nominations for Best Supporting Actor nonetheless, including from Satellite Awards, Critics' Choice Movie Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and more.</p><h2 id=helena-bonham-carter><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Helena Bonham Carter</span></h2><p>If you're familiar with her face, chances are you've seen the English sweetheart somewhere else, including in the <strong><a href=#>Harry Potter </a></strong>series where she portrays the villainous Bellatrix Lestrange. The movie franchise has become one of the world's most bankable, amassing over a whopping $7.7 billion from its eight films from 2007 to 2011. She, then, reunited with Daniel Radcliffe and co. for an HBO Max's special of Harry Potter's 20th anniversary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Unusual Way Brad Pitt Got In Shape For 'Fight Club'</a></span></p><p>Additionally, the proud mother has also starred in many recent Netflix hits, including in Henry Cavill and Millie Bobby Brown's 2020 mystery flick Enola Holmes. She also has two Oscar nominations in her decades-spanning career; as the Best Actress in The Wings of the Dove from 1997 and Best Supporting Actress in The King's Speech in 2010.</p><h2 id=edward-norton><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Edward Norton</span></h2><p>Before Fight Club, Edward Norton was already a big name with impressive back catalog. He had an illustrious debut in Primal Fear in 1996 and gained an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his work as a well-reformed neo-Nazi in American History X in 1998. He's also tried his luck in directing and managing, having founded production company Class 5 Films in 2003 and has been credited behind the scene for movies like Down in the Valley and The Painted Veil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that being said, the actor did not throw in his towels from acting at all. The troublesome actor, who'd gained reputation as someone difficult to work with despite his critical plaudits, also starred in big titles like The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Incredible Hulk, and more. He's now gearing up for an upcoming Knives Out sequel with Dave Bautista, Daniel Craig, and more.</p><h2 id=brad-pitt><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Brad Pitt</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt has pretty much accomplished anything an actor would have ever dreamed of, as well as becoming one of Hollywood's most powerful men. Listing all of his best works here wouldn't do justice to the 58-year-old movie star, but some of his essential films are Ocean's Eleven, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, World War Z, Moneyball, 12 Years a Slave, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, and many, many, many more. However, the actor has been attempting to expand his empire. He's recently teamed up with a French record producer to re-open his Miraval Studios after two decades of uncertainty, and signed a deal with Apple to direct an upcoming racing film on Formula 1.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How An Actual Fight Inspired 'Fight Club'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYyfoKCgpGKwrcHBZpqaq6RitaK%2FjJ2mp51dqLavr8Rmmq6kpGKwra3SrKCcZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ddg-net-worth-how-much-is-ddg-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;DDG Net Worth How Much is DDG Worth?</a>
