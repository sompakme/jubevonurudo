At the time, Weber was married to Small, and they had a baby son, Sean.</p><p>Despite the complicated situation, Joel was absolutely taken by her. Joel and Weber soon engaged in an affair. When the liaison was discovered by Small, Weber left both her lovers behind and vanished for several weeks.</p><p>A 21-year-old Joel phoned Small to beg for his forgiveness and then overdosed. Small rushed to Joel's side and got there just in time. But just a few short weeks later, Joel tried again, this time drinking furniture polish. Another family member found him, and this time, Joel checked himself into a mental hospital, where he stayed for three weeks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After much thought, he decided to pursue a relationship with Weber, who also agreed to manage him. They married in September 1973. “She’s Got a Way” and “She’s Always a Woman” were inspired by her. As his wife, Weber was entitled to 50 percent of Joel’s worth and was also taking a cut of his earnings as manager. She brought her brother, Frank, to manage her new husband's finances.</p><p><strong>In 1982, Weber filed for divorce and Joel was devastated. Joel did everything to woo her back and bought her a $4 million townhouse on the Upper East Side and an Alfa Romeo car.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/elton-john-billy-joel-face2face-tour.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Billy Joel And Elton John Have A Long And Tangled History, But Are They Friends Today?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Elton John and Billy Joel were rock's biggest package tour until they seemingly parted under disputed circumstances.</span><p>But after breaking both his hands in a motorcycle accident, Weber made the ultimate act of betrayal.

Trying to find solace in his music, he found a piano bar and began playing. A few moments later, supermodels Elle Macpherson, then just 19, and Christie Brinkley, 28, walked in. The catwalk queens arrived alongside a then-undiscovered Whitney Houston. Out of the three beautiful women there that night, Joel fell in love with Brinkley.
