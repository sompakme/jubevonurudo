One can be an influencer as a model, a political commentator, a streamer, and more. Many influencers become as popular as they are through genuine content creation, while others are allegedly just trying to make a quick buck.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Casinos, Restaurants, And More Celebrity Businesses That Totally Flopped</a></span>It is not hard to become an influencer, one just needs to go viral or generate some degree of outrage, and from there, one can bend followers to their whim, often in the direction of their wallets. These streamers, Youtube personalities, <a href=#>and even major podcasters </a>like Joe Rogan have all been accused of grifting. That does not necessarily mean they are guilty, but it remains a fact that these people have yet to shake off the allegation permanently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-walsh><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Matt Walsh</span></h2><p>Matt Walsh is most famous for being adamantly anti-trans. His so-called documentary What Is A Woman started immediate backlash, and the guy was quick to tweet about children's genitals in the wake of a mass shooting in Colorado. One might have seen ads for his videos on Youtube, where he streams regularly. But Walsh reportedly got many of the trans people who agreed to be interviewed for his movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">under false pretense</a><a href=#>s</a>.</p><h2 id=mr-beast><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mr. Beast</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although he is arguably the most popular YouTuber alive to date, Jimmy Donaldson, A.K.A. Mr. Beast, has earned his fair share of detractors. Although no official allegations or charges have been levied against him, yet, many online do not trust Mr. Beast. <a href=#>One Reddit user called him, "a shill."</a> Another YouTuber alleged that Mr. Beast took millions in government aid to fund his so-called philanthropy. Sure, popularity attracts haters, but the streamer would be wise to tread lightly, cancelation could be imminent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Viral Star Mr. Beast Gives Away 40 Different Cars To One Lucky Channel Subscriber</a></span></p><h2 id=stephen-crowder><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Stephen Crowder</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Crowder is a "comedian" or at least he self-identifies that way, which is ironic since he doesn't seem to care or respect how anyone else identifies. But with his click bait titles, use of hyperbole, and shock jock conservativism he can drive ample business to his many, many merchandise stores. Is Crowder trying to advocate for the right-wing, or is he just trying to make a few bucks off of the outrage he attempts to generate?</p><h2 id=shaun-king><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shaun King</span></h2><p>While Crowder allegedly grifts the right, Shaun King has been accused of grifting from the left. King became famous for his activism, namely for his support and coverage of the Black Lives Matter movement. As his popularity grew, so did speculation that he was doing business less than reputably. Some say that King mishandled funds and <a href=#>funneled donations for charitable causes into his own pockets.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alex-jones><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alex Jones</span></h2><p>Jones tried to defend himself from the repercussions of his actions in court by declaring that his streaming persona was <a href=#>"a character."</a> That defense did not bode well <a href=#>in his child custody battle</a> with Kelly Rebecca Nichols. It wouldn't be a surprise if that were true though, as Jones is famous for saying some of the most ridiculous things a human is capable of saying.</p><p>He has ranted about "gay frogs," and spread lies that mass shootings have been staged acts of conspiracy. Through the traffic Jones generates with his outrageous comments, he sells vitamins and supplements. Jones's multi-million empire might soon crumble to nothing, after a lengthy court case he has been ordered to pay over $400 million to the families of the Parkland shooting victims for defamation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-rogan><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Joe Rogan</span></h2><p>Unlike Jones, it is not likely that Rogan's schtick is just an act. His antimask, right-wing apologist, and transphobic comments have cemented him as a symbol of the alt-right. And like Jones, Rogan uses his platform to sell vitamins to his followers. Many of <a href=#>the products Joe Rogan advertises are questionable</a> and Rogan does not have a good reputation for fact-checking. He once said that they were giving kids in schools litter boxes and that horse medicine could cure Covid.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Joe Rogan And Jim Carrey?</a></span></p><h2 id=candace-owens><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Candace Owens</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Owens has been one of Donald Trump's most vocal defenders, she has also been accused of being a precocious con artist. While she is notoriously against the Black Lives Matter movement and is frequently platformed by the right as a Black voice against it, <a href=#>she has a very inconsistent track record </a>in that regard.</p><p>She claims racial oppression is not a problem, yet with <a href=#>the help of the NAACP</a>, she sued her school for racial discrimination. Allegedly, she is also said to be the one pushing Kanye West to the right, which has since led Kanye to claim he will buy Parler, a failing conservative social media app <a href=#>run by her husband George Williams</a>.</p><h2 id=ben-shapiro><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ben Shapiro</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shapiro also tends to generate a lot of outrage with his defense of Donald Trump and far-right commentary. While he sells himself as an intellectual, many have pointed out that all Shapiro does is use a handful of blatant, unethical debate tactics to talk over people he disagrees. Many Reddit users <a href=#>have put together compilations of Shapiro saying</a>, "utter nonsense." Posters went on to say, "Either Ben Shapiro is Unintelligent or Grifting." As Owens, Crowder, and Alex Jones all demonstrate, there is much money to be made in generating conservative outrage.</p><h2 id=andrew-tate><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Andrew Tate</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tate is a notorious misogynist who has been accused of human trafficking and beating women. <a href=#>Before his podcast and TikTok empire</a> were destroyed, Tate claimed he taught men how to be as "successful" as him through his program, "Hustler University." <a href=#>The whole thing turned out to be one notoriously blatant MLM pyramid scheme</a>. Since being outed for his grift and canceled for his misogyny, Hustler University was forced to close its doors. Tate continues to podcast but is no longer platformed on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqraqVlrqmvtJmraWnl5yys7%2BMmqWdZaCksaSt0q2cq6tdrLWwecearZ5lkpqyr3nAnJquq5WZerCyjKCpop6knruoew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./debbi-fields-net-worth-therichest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Debbi Fields Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
