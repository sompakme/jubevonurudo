The couple appeared on New York Live on Tuesday to promote the show and a forthcoming album.</p><p>“For now, it was a time for us where we’re making music together, and we really wanted people to come on that journey with us and have a deeper look into our lives,” Simpson-Ross said of why they chose to make the reality show now.</p><p>“It started with us just documenting us making the album. And then, in the process, we kind of realized most of the inspiration was coming from our home life, our children, and things like that,” Ross added.</p><p>The two recently celebrated their fourth anniversary on Friday (August 31) by both sharing Instagram posts on their respective pages. See Simpson-Ross’s post below and look out for the couple’s new single, “I Do,” on September 7.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=evan-ross-music></span><span>Evan Ross Music</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>How to Live Alone</li><li>I do</li><li>Yes Me</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=evan-ross-movies-%e2%80%93-evan-ross-films></span><span>Evan Ross Movies –&nbsp;Evan Ross Films</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>ATL</li><li>Pride</li><li>Gardens of the Night</li><li>Linewatch</li><li>According to Greta</li><li>Life Is Hot in Cracktown</li><li>Black Water Transit</li><li>Case 219</li><li>Mooz-lum</li><li>The Family Tree</li><li>96 Minutes</li><li>Jeff, Who Lives at Home Kevin</li><li>N.Y.C.
