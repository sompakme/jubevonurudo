More than a century after it was written, the story is still loved by audiences.</p><p>It’s possible that one of the secrets behind its success is that the characters, though appearing outlandish, display mental disorders that are relatable to many people in the real world.</p><p>Does the theory that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice in Wonderland is really a story about mental illness </a>hold any weight?

While any literary character is open to interpretation, it has been widely theorized that the author of the classic work, Lewis Carroll, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">drew inspiration from the treatment of mental illness in the 19th century.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Open Culture reports that Carroll’s uncle, Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge, was an officer of the Lunacy Commission. The organization supervised mental health institutions, then called "lunatic asylums". It is believed that Carroll used his knowledge of mental disorders and what was understood about them at the time to help mold his characters.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Historical Inaccuracies In Classic Disney Cartoons</a></span></p><p>So what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mental disorders do the classic Alice in Wonderland characters seem to display?</a></p><p>According to The Odyssey Online, the Mad Hatter, one of the most significant characters, displays Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. At least in the Tim Burton adaptation of the story, where the character is played by Johnny Depp, he suffers frequent flashbacks of his village being attacked by the Red Queen, which sparks angry outbursts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The character also seems to show signs of Bipolar Disorder as he is at times gloomy and depressed before experiencing manic episodes of excitement.</p><p>The story’s villain, the Red Queen, appears to have Narcissistic Personality Disorder, evidenced by the way she is completely self-absorbed and lacks empathy for others. Her “off with their head” demands suggest Paranoid Personality Disorder as she is convinced that everyone is out to get her.</p><p>The twin characters of Tweedledee and Tweedledum may display Shared Psychotic Disorder, which The Odyssey Online defines as “a psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief and hallucinations are transmitted from one individual to another.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Deleted Scene That Was Too Dark For 'The Lion King'</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, the White Rabbit is believed by some to symbolize Generalized Anxiety Disorder as he is constantly worried about being late. The rabbit also displays other common signs of the disorder, including twitching, restlessness, and agitation.</p><p>It appears that many of the Alice in Wonderland characters may symbolize mental illnesses, but what about Alice herself?</p><h2 id=what-disorder-does-alice-have-in-lsquo-alice-in-wonderland-rsquo>What Disorder Does Alice Have In ‘Alice In Wonderland’?</h2><p>According to Owlcation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice seems to be struggling primarily with an eating disorder</a>. This is first alluded to when she arrives in Wonderland and dramatically changes size after eating or drinking the foods and potions she can access. This may show how those with disordered eating may feel like they drastically change size even after only consuming one thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When Alice eats, she doesn’t simply take a small bite but rather binges and then regrets her actions later,” the publication explains, adding, “Alice is stuck in a cycle in which she overeats and then has to eat or drink even more to correct her initial consumption. She essentially relies on food to solve her problems.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Princess Ariel Was Inspired By Alyssa Milano?

It’s no wonder fans find her to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the worst Disney characters!</a></p><p>One of the <a href=#>lesser-known facts about Ariel from A Little Mermaid</a> is that she is believed by some to be Disposophobic, otherwise known as a hoarder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Book My Show explains that hoarders create emotional attachments with worthless items and avoid showing what they’ve collected to other people out of fear of shaming.
