I never got offered that."</p><p>He has a sense of humor about not getting the part: he explained.

According to&nbsp;Biography.com, she was interviewed by&nbsp;RollingStone,&nbsp;she cried a lot while reading the screenplay and just felt that it was a great project for her. She said, "Right, I’ve absolutely got to be a part of this. No two ways about it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Winslet was very determined to get cast in&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;and even got James Cameron's number from her agent and called him. He was&nbsp;driving on the highway and that didn't stop her, as she told him that she really needed to play a role in this movie.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly, Winslet did two camera tests and was hired.</p><p>It worked out well as Winslet and DiCaprio not only played Rose and Jack perfectly and have been so loved since, but they became pals in the process.&nbsp;In 2016, Winslet talked to&nbsp;People&nbsp;and called DiCaprio "a great friend."&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;Glamour UK, the actress mentioned that the two stars really do talk about the movie that brought them both a lot of recognition and praise. She said, "we’re very, very close and sometimes we do quote the odd Titanic line back and forth to each another, because only we can, and we find it really funny.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Did Leonardo DiCaprio Earn From His Role In ’Titanic’?</a></span></p><h2 id=celebrating-20-years>Celebrating 20 Years</h2><p>It's not surprising to hear that when Kate Winslet read the screenplay for&nbsp;Titanic, she cried, as it's impossible to watch&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;and not cry (or sob). Many people remember watching this movie for the first time and being overcome with so much sadness and other emotions.</p><p>The movie turned 20 years old in 2017, and according to&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly,&nbsp;there was actually some public outcry before the movie hit theatres.

And this is even sweeter: in 2004, Leonardo DiCaprio was interviewed on the&nbsp;Oprah Winfrey Show&nbsp;and said that Kate&nbsp;Winslet was his "favorite" person to kiss in a movie.
