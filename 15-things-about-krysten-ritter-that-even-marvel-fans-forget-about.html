acting business for more than a decade after starting her career with a number of small TV roles, but it seems that it's only recently that the 36-year-old has become a well-known face because of her role as Jessica Jones in the Netflix original show of the same name. The actress has also starred in Breaking Bad and Don't Trust The B---- In Apartment 23, which had a good run with Ritter portraying the main character Chloe throughout the show.</p><p>There are a number of actresses who have been able to step into the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the past few years and with Jessica Jones recently unveiling their second season. Ritter has become a star in her own right. Given that Jessica Jones is aimed at adults and not teenagers like many other Marvel shows, there is much more darkness to the character, something that many of Netflix's original series centring around Marvel characters have followed over the past few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marvel executives would want fans to see Ritter as the character that they have created throughout the series and not be able to find photos of her that ruin the image of the superhero that is best known for her strength. The following list looks at just 15&nbsp;things that Jessica Jones fans might not know about the star of the show.</p><h2 id=the-show-doesn-t-allow-ritter-to-show-off-her-legs>The Show&nbsp;Doesn't Allow Ritter To Show Off Her Legs</h2><p>Many superheroes are able to show off their figures as part of their character, including Black Widow, who is portrayed by Scarlett Johansson. Ritter's character isn't given the same kinds of opportunities, since the former model's legs are usually hidden underneath oversized jeans.</p><p>Ritter's legs and model figure were the main reason why she was able to climb through the ranks in the acting world so effortlessly because she is someone who is completely unique. That being said, her physical appearance isn't something that the producers of the series cared about when she was cast so they haven't allowed her to show off her legs very much throughout. Even though she isn't able to dress up as part of the show, Ritter always shows up at premieres with her legs on show to ensure that her fans are still able to catch a glimpse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-want-to-distance-themselves-from-the-show-don-t-trust-the-girl-in-apartment-23>They Want To Distance Themselves From The Show Don't Trust The&nbsp;Girl In Apartment 23</h2><p>When Ritter was cast in the role of Jessica Jones, this was the first time that many fans have spotted her. Even though Ritter has starred in Breaking Bad, The Blacklist and Gossip Girl in recent years, she wasn't a well-known star.</p><p>This means that many fans were forced to look up Ritter and some of the work that she has done outside of the Netflix series and her role as Chloe in Don't Trust The B---- In Apartment 23 is definitely one that the Marvel crew would want to distance themselves from. It was a much riskier character and the complete opposite of what Jessica Jones is trying to be so some of the photoshoot images from the show would definitely be off the table as well. It seems that executives didn't look at Ritter's past roles before they allowed her to step into Jessica Jones' shoes.</p><h2 id=was-ritter-chosen-for-the-right-character>Was Ritter Chosen For The Right Character?</h2><p>Green isn't a color that many women choose to wear, especially when they are dressing up and attempting to make themselves look more feminine. Ritter isn't an ordinary woman and she has spent the last decade showing her fans just how different she really is. She was blessed with raven hair, never-ending legs and a razor-sharp bone structure that has allowed her to step out in so many risky outfits that only she would ever be able to pull off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here she is shown looking more like super villain/hero Poison Ivy than&nbsp;Jessica Jones and incredibly, this look suits her much more than her role on the Netflix show. Is it possible that Ritter was cast as the wrong superhero? This image will definitely raise some questions in the future, questions that the executives of Jessica Jones would rather not have to answer.</p><h2 id=photoshoots-before-she-was-cast-as-jessica-jones>Photoshoots Before She Was Cast As Jessica Jones</h2><p>Krysten Ritter started her career by starring in small TV roles in Veronica&nbsp;Mars and Gilmore Girls more than a decade ago. Even though it wasn't until 2004 that Ritter was able to appear in TV shows, she actually began her acting career back in 2001 when she appeared as an uncredited model in Someone Like You, which was a romantic comedy that also starred Hugh Grant.</p><p>Ritter went on to appear in a number of other movies before she landed her first role in a TV series, which was as Brynn in NBC show Whoopi back in 2004. This then led to a number of other roles and kickstarted her career. It's easy to see that Ritter has come a long way in the past 17 years, but it seems that taking a trip down memory lane isn't something that Marvel Executives want to do with the biggest star of their popular Netflix show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ritter-completely-changed-her-image-for-jessica-jones>Ritter Completely Changed Her Image For Jessica Jones</h2><p>Ritter may have been cast as one of the strongest female characters that the Marvel Cinematic Universe currently has, but securing the role was just the beginning of the hard work that Ritter then had to put in.</p><p>Knowing that Jessica Jones has become best known for her strength, Ritter was forced to work out for a number of months in order to reach the physical image that was required in order for it to be believable. Ritter also read the entire comic book series to ensure that she was completely prepared for the twists and turns of the show and that she understood her character. Looking at images from before she was cast in the show, it's obvious that she has changed her image and physique. The above photo shows just how much slimmer Krysten used to be. The role has allowed her to add a lot of upper body muscle.</p><h2 id=jessica-jones-should-never-be-seen-in-a-dress>Jessica Jones Should Never Be&nbsp;Seen In A Dress</h2><p>Jessica Jones is a brooding member of Marvel's defenders, who is often seen in the same ripped jeans, tank top, and jacket. The character isn't the kind of person to be seen in makeup or heels and definitely wouldn't be spotted wearing a dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Images of Ritter looking stunning from when she was seen portraying characters like Chloe from Don't Trust the B----- In Apartment 23 definitely ruin the illusion of the character she currently portrays since she needs to be able to look like the rough looking superhero who is completely&nbsp;absorbed by her work and rarely ever seen without her choice of liquor. The fact that Ritter is absolutely beautiful underneath the character she portrays could be more of a curse than a blessing for the executives when it comes to trying to protect the image of the Jessica Jones character that has been well-known for years.</p><h2 id=ritter-s-background-in-modelling>Ritter's Background In&nbsp;Modelling</h2><p>Even though Ritter's acting career is something that she's become best-known for over the past decade, she got her start in the business as a model. The actress was scouted in a shopping mall when she was just 15 years old and this then led to her juggling her high school days with traveling to modelling events in New York and Philadelphia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ritter later moved to New York City and signed her first professional modelling contract when she was 18 years old. This then allowed her to appear on covers of a number of well-known magazines as well as walking the runway in New York, Milan, Paris, and Tokyo. It was this modelling work that allowed the star to break into the acting business, but it isn't a past that Marvel executives would like fans of the show to be able to read about, especially since it comes with these kinds of images.</p><h2 id=does-jessica-jones-have-tattoos>Does Jessica Jones Have Tattoos?</h2><p>Jessica Jones is one of Marvel's defenders and it's all about allowing the character to maintain the image that comic books gave to her a long time ago. Of course, Ritter is a working actress and has been seen as a number of other characters on screen while&nbsp;she has appeared in the shoes of the character and this includes her role in Asthma.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ritter portrayed Ruby in the movie that was released back in 2014 and in order for her to completely adapt to the role, Ritter was forced to wear a number of fake tattoos on her legs. There are a number of images of her dressed this way online and this could ruin the illusion of the character that she is currently portraying on Netflix since Jones doesn't have any tattoos and there has never been a point where she has wanted one.</p><h2 id=they-make-sure-not-to-objectify-the-character>They Make Sure Not To Objectify The Character</h2><p>The actress was scouted as a model when she was just 15 because even at that age it was apparent that she had a figure that was perfect for modelling. Over the past decade and a half since she quit modelling back in 2001, Ritter has continued to look after her health, eat well and even spend some time in the gym, which could be why she still has a figure that many women would&nbsp;do anything&nbsp;for.</p><p>It isn't a figure that she's ever able to use to her advantage on the Marvel-based show, which is definitely a shame since she looks like this. These kinds of outfits were used when she was part of Don't Trust The B---- In Apartment 23,&nbsp;but they haven't been something that has come out of her wardrobe in recent years. If fans saw some of these images of the former model, there would definitely be requests for the show's producers to change up her style in the coming seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ritter-s-band-ex-vivian>Ritter's Band Ex-Vivian</h2><p>Ritter is a former model, a writer, and an actress but this isn't the end when it comes to the list of things that the star is able to do. In her spare time, Ritter is the lead vocalist and guitarist for a band called Ex-Vivian.</p><p>Back in 2012, Ritter released an album which was described by her record studio as something between the atmosphere of Mazzy Starr and the American Twang of Stevie Nicks. Her writing talents came in handy when it came to not only writing all of the songs for the album but then singing them as well. Ritter's talents are seemingly endless. How long will it be before we see Jessica Jones holding a guitar and serenading some of her enemies? It would definitely give the show an interesting swerve if they allowed Jones to become a musician.</p><h2 id=ritter-s-beauty-has-been-toned-down>Ritter's Beauty Has Been Toned Down</h2><p>It's become quite obvious that Ritter's character on the show has been toned down a lot when it comes to her looks. Over the past decade, the star has become known for her unique look and her stunning model figure but it seems that this is mostly covered up in the attire that she is forced to wear when she's on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ritter wears oversized jeans and a leather jacket most of the time, which means that the show runners are obviously trying to hide her figure and her beauty because they were not supposed to be seen as part of the role. The above image shows that Ritter is stunning when she is allowed to dress up, but the role sees her playing a character who is not very feminine and images like this definitely spoil the illusion, since Jones isn't a character who needs to use her gender to her advantage.</p><h2 id=black-leather-and-jeans-aren-t-the-only-things-that-ritter-looks-good-in>Black Leather And Jeans Aren't The Only Things That Ritter Looks Good In</h2><p>Krysten Ritter was said to be at top&nbsp;of the list of actresses to play the role of Jessica Jones when the show was first planned a number of years ago. Showrunner and executive Melissa Rosenberg had Ritter at the top of her list but despite this, Teresa Palmer, Alexandra Daddario, Jessica De Gouw and Marin Ireland were are also considered for the role before Ritter was officially unveiled as the newest addition to the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ritter's acting experience was one of the things that drew the show executives to her as well as the fact that she is totally unique. Ritter has become known for her slim, tall figure but she was actually bullied for it when she was younger, so at least she has been able to do something positive with the fact that she looks different.</p><h2 id=krysten-knows-how-to-look-glam-as-well>Krysten Knows How To Look Glam As Well</h2><p>Ritter has definitely proved that she is the perfect person to portray one of Marvel's strongest female characters over the past few years, but while Ritter has adapted to the dark side of the character, it seems that there are a lot of images online that show that Ritter is completely different from Jessica Jones and often dresses up and shows that she is absolutely stunning.</p><p>Ritter has appeared on a number of red carpets and this image is&nbsp;also proof that when Ritter isn't wearing ripped jeans and that heavy leather jacket, she is a completely different person.&nbsp;Jessica Jones has a feminine side, something that the comic book writers never actually gave to her. Could Jones' history as a model be a problem in the future?</p><h2 id=ritter-has-a-number-of-hidden-talents>Ritter Has A Number Of Hidden Talents</h2><p>It seems that the former model has more talents than many of her fans are actually aware. Ritter is said to have a passion for writing and has not only sold a TV pilot based on her career and experiences as a model, but it is rumored that she has also written a female-buddy comedy screenplay, which means that Ritter could be attempting to start a career behind the camera in the near future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ritter has obviously signed on to be part of the series for as long as Netflix decides to push it forward so it can't be good news for the show to see that Ritter has other passions in her life. Many of these passions could not only take up her spare time, but that also means that she would want to pursue something different in the future and they would then have to recast the role that has become iconic to Ritter in recent years.</p><h2 id=ritter-has-always-looked-better-in-black>Ritter Has Always Looked Better In Black</h2><p>There are a number of reasons why Krysten was chosen for the role of Jessica Jones and it seems that one of these reasons was the fact that the actress looks fantastic in black. While she is always seen without makeup and usually, in the same clothes, the company would prefer it if fans didn't know that away from the series, Ritter can dress up and look&nbsp;great.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 36-year-old has also dipped her toe in the modelling pool, which could be why there are so many photoshoot images of her online that are easily accessible to fans of the show. Ritter looks stunning in all of these photoshoots, but many are not the kinds of images that Marvel executives would want to use to promote the series about a woman who has never tried to use her&nbsp;feminine wiles to her advantage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLBqbXNoKpmmZKkwrV5yquwrKyVo3qztdOtnKtlpJ2utXnEr5ynZZ2Wv7exy2admqajYrOwvsaeq2aZkqTCtXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./19-best-purses-and-handbags-from-50-to-700-shop-with-us.html>&#171;&nbsp;19 Best Purses and Handbags from $50 to $700 - Shop With Us</a>
