The show wasn't always sticking to the script, and was completely open to changing lines, while giving their main cast members the freedom to improv from time to time.</p><p>This created some special moments, and iconic lines. <a href=#>Matthew Perry was known for his brilliance and going off-script</a>. His iconic, "you need to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance," to Joey was an unscripted line.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>During Her Time On Friends, Kristin Davis Was Most Impressed By Lisa Kudrow</a></span></p><p>Among the other memorable unscripted lines, includes Ross' "I take the Rachel" line, <a href=#>which was inspired by the show after an outtake from David Schwimmer</a>, who accidentally said Rachel in one his lines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston also received a huge ovation for her improv skills</a>, arguing with Ross over their marriage.

Although she fit right in from a standpoint on-screen, it wasn't the same ordeal behind the scenes.</p><p>Coolidge admitted that she wanted to share some creative output in regards to her character, but <a href=#>the showrunners really weren't open to any ideas outside of the script.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Sometimes I think people want to hear my ad-libs when I get on a show, and they really don't.

That was a serious show."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Friends Guest-Star 'Wasn't Prepared' For The Boos She Got From The Live Studio Audience</a></span></p><p>Coolidge would also refer to the vibe behind the scenes as serious, despite the fact that she knew Lisa Kudrow prior.</p><p>"The vibe was pretty serious," she continued.

Some had a blast, while others called the main stars of the show, a clique.</p><p>As for Jennifer Coolidge, she said the vibe was intimidating, given the good looks and star power of the main cast.</p><p>"I have to say, I was kind of intimidated, even though I knew Lisa because she was in a comedy group. But I didn't know the rest of them, and I was very intimidated because they were all so attractive and had it going on."</p><p>"I'm just going to do my little part and I'll be in my dressing room."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coolidge did say the main cast was very nice, but that she kept to herself during the guest cameo. The actress would also reveal that she got the freedom to do her own thing while dancing on the show.</p><p>"The only thing I improvised was they wanted me to dance awkwardly, so I felt like I had a natural ability to dance that way. I think that was the only time they didn’t give me direction; they wanted me to say the lines and call it a day."</p><p>Despite the direction, Coolidge thrived in her small part on the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoycpqikmZm0pnnIp6uipZmZrrW1zaBknrCgmr%2Bqsc2cnGannmKzs7XEp5usZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./liev-schreiber-apologizes-to-ariana-madix-after-nyt-profile.html>&#171;&nbsp;Liev Schreiber Apologizes to Ariana Madix After 'NYT' Profile</a>
