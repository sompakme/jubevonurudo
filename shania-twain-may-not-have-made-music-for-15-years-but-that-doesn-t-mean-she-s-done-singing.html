She completed her Las Vegas residency earlier this year and is preparing for her next big venture. Her new album Queen of Me is set to release the first week of February, and it will be followed by a world tour throughout 2023.</p><h2 id=shania-twain-faced-many-struggles-before-stardom>Shania Twain Faced Many Struggles Before Stardom</h2><p>Christened Eilleen Regina Edwards, the Canadian singer was just eight years old when she began performing in bars to support her struggling family. Her childhood wasn’t a happy one.</p><p>Ultimately, the singer was on the brink of a breakthrough when her parents were killed in a car crash. Shania, 22 at the time, headed home and spent the next six years caring for her four siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At last, at the age of 27, her break came. She was signed to a record label. Her stepfather was born an Ojibwa Native American, and Eilleen changed her name to Shania, the Ojibwa word for “on my way.”</p><p>Although her first album wasn’t a commercial success, it attracted the notice of famed music producer Mutt Lange. Lange and Twain married within six months of their meeting. Their working partnership proved to be formidable.</p><h2 id=how-did-shania-twain-become-a-superstar>How Did Shania Twain Become A Superstar?</h2><p>The Woman in Me, released in 1995, went platinum twelve times and won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album. Shania became an international sensation, earning the title “Queen of Country Pop.”</p><p>Fans loved her, calling <a href=#>Shania one of the sweethearts of the country scene</a>. Two years later, she released her record-breaking album Come on Over. It remains the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bestselling studio album of all time by a female artist</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After taking a break for the birth of their son, Eja, Shania returned in 2004 with her fourth album, Up! It was another smash hit, which saw the singer become the only female artist to have three straight diamond albums in the US.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened to Shania Twain’s Voice?</a></span></p><h2 id=things-took-a-turn-for-shania-twain>Things Took A Turn For Shania Twain</h2><p>During the Up! tour, the singer was bitten by a tick while horseback riding in Virginia. Initially, tests for Lyme disease were negative, but Shania began to struggle on stage.</p><p>Suffering bouts of dizziness and blackouts, she also struggled to control her voice. Initially, she thought it was the result of fatigue, brought about by the tour and being a new mom, but the condition persisted, and she had to stop performing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then came the second blow. In the midst of coping with the panic about her voice, <a href=#>Shania learned that Lange was having an affair with her best friend</a> and personal assistant, Marie-Anne Thiébaud. The women had been pregnant at the same time and shared a close bond. Shania was devastated.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Shania Twain's Painful Divorce Affected Her Career</a></span></p><p>It took six years before it was discovered that the icon had, in fact, been infected by the tick bite. Untreated, Lyme disease can lead to serious problems.</p><p>In Shania's case, it affected her voice, making it impossible for her to sing. The short recovery break she had planned turned into 15 long years.</p><p>She continued to write songs, acutely aware that she might never sing them herself. But eventually, after vocal cord surgeries and special therapy, her voice slowly began to return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2011-was-shania-rsquo-s-comeback-year>2011 Was Shania’s Comeback Year</h2><p>The year started off well, with the singer remarrying on New Year’s Day, 2011. Amazingly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shania had found comfort in the arms of Marie-Anne’s jilted husband, Frédéric Thiébaud</a>.</p><p>In May, the superstar released her autobiography. Titled From This Moment On, she described the book as: “Part confessional, part warning, part self-help manual for people going through similar crises."</p><p>She later said writing it helped her realize the divorce was not the most devastating event in her life.</p><p>In the same year, she was approached by Lionel Richie, who asked her to join him for a re-record of his hit duet Endless Love. Although she initially refused, Richie managed to convince her otherwise, and his nurturing helped to rebuild her confidence. The song was included on his album Tuskegee, released in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a turning point. Twain’s comeback single Today is Your Day, the first song she made without Lange in 18 years, was released at the same time as a documentary series about the singer, Why Not? with Shania Twain.</p><h2 id=shania-twain-started-performing-live-again>Shania Twain Started Performing Live Again</h2><p>The next year, although she required physical therapy and longer vocal warmups to prepare, she also restarted live performances.
