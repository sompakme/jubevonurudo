As such, she has managed to amass a $22 million fortune. And with 'Euphoria' being greenlit for a third season, in conjunction with two films that are completed and waiting for the SAG-AFTRA strike to end to be released, (<strong>including 'Dune 2', where Zendaya has a much larger role than the first</strong>) it appears that Zendaya's net worth is only going to increase for years to come.</p><h2 id=zendaya-39-s-start-with-disney>Zendaya's Start With Disney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar40632880-1.jpg><p>Zendaya has made it clear that she is a force to be reckoned with! The star first began her career out as a theater actor and backup dancer before landing herself the role of Rocky Blue on Disney Channel's Good Luck Charlie.

And her first big role found her co-starring with Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman.</p><p>The success of The Greatest Showman and Disney led Zendaya to work as a voice actor in a couple of films.

This is because while the drama in the show deals with teenagers, the storyline is dark. As such, older crowds come flocking to watch, which has led to the continuing success of Euphoria.</p><p>The hit show managed to out-perform Big Little Lies and Barry on HBO. The first season alone, there were over 2.3 million viewers tuning in to watch. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">But by the second season, 16.3 million viewers were tuning in for each episode</a>. The only show that outperformed Euphoria on HBO was Game of Thrones.</p><p>Some of the added success from the show came from the fact that Zendaya won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">becoming the youngest winner in that category</a>.</p><p>With Euphoria greenlit for Season Three, there is no telling just how much Zendaya will be paid to return to her Emmy-winning role.
