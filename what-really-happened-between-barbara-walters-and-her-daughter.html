After one agonizing month, Barbara Walters decided to take drastic action; forcefully enrolling Jacqueline in an intervention program in Idaho.</p><p>Although Jacqueline initially resented her mother’s action, she would later admit that she’d “have been dead” were it not for the timely intervention.
