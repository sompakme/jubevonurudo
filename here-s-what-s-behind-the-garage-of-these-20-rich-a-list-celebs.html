Having a luxurious car means you've made it, and there's nothing better than showing off your hot rod while driving down Hollywood Boulevard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of people are obsessed with cars and going to auto shows. However, if you're rich and famous, you don't just dream and obsess over these expensive rides; you go out and buy them whatever the cost. Stars like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay Leno</a> literally have a garage full of exotic and antique vehicles and his most expensive car is reportedly a Jay Leno's Rolls-Royce Silver Spur Limousine that's a whopping $14 million! It's not only the guys riding around in these luxury cars either. Have you seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a>'s orange Lamborghini Aventador? The reality star dished out an insane $450,000 for her ride, and it's just one of many cars she owns. She also has a Ferrari Spider, Mercedes Maybach, and Rolls Royce.</p><p>But which celeb has the most expensive car sitting in their garage? You'll have to scroll through this list of twenty of the hottest and expensive vehicles owned by the rich and famous to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-s-maserati-quattroporte---105-000><strong>Lindsay Lohan's Maserati Quattroporte - $105,000</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a> may have had a weakness for a party-lifestyle, but she also has a soft spot for luxurious Italian sports cars. Lohan has been photographed many times driving around in a Maserati Quattroporte that has an estimated price tag of over $100,000. However, LiLo has had terrible luck with cars. She's been arrested numerous times for driving under the influence and had more car trouble when she had her assistant behind the wheel of her white Maserati and she collided with a Subaru in front of them. To top it all off, Lohan was also accused of hitting a woman with a stroller with her Maserati. Maybe Lohan should find a new brand of car to fall in love with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=halle-berry-s-aston-martin-v8-vantage-volante---110-000><strong>Halle Berry's Aston Martin V8 Vantage Volante - $110,000</strong></h2><p>We all know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle Berry</a> from movies like Catwoman, Monster's Ball,&nbsp;and X-Men, and she's one of Hollywood's most adored actresses. The star also has a thing for classic cars, and her Aston Martin V8 Vantage Volante is a beauty when it comes to vehicles. The star was spotted by paparazzi leaving in her black Aston Martin after having lunch in West Hollywood, and we can't help but be a tad jealous. Obviously, riding around in anything with the name Aston Martin comes with a hefty price. It's been reported that the former Bond girl shelled out about $110,000 for her luxurious car.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-s-audi-r8-gt---162-000><strong>Lady Gaga's Audi R8 GT - $162,000</strong></h2><p>You'd think that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a> would be driving something outrageous like a bright-colored car with unicorns detailed on it, but the extravagant singer is actually riding around in something way classier and sportier than you think. Not to disappoint all you Lady Gaga fans (or Monsters, as they are known), but the "Born This Way" singer is actually driving an Audi R8 GT. So the car isn't as flashy as we would think the singer would drive in, but hey, it's still a $162,000 hot rod, and she looks really good&nbsp;riding in the driver's seat of the silver car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-s-ferrari-f430---186-925><strong>Kim Kardashian's Ferrari F430 - $186,925</strong></h2><p>You won't ever catch <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a> driving something that costs less than the price of a house nowadays. And even if you're still bewildered as to why she became so rich and famous, don't worry, we still are too. Regardless, the reality star has made millions by just being her, and her rides are always ridiculously expensive. Here the Keeping Up With the Kardashians&nbsp;star was pictured driving around in a Ferrari F430, which is priced at a whopping $186,925. The car can go up to a speed of 200 mph, and we aren't really sure why Kim needs such a fast car, but she sure does look good driving in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-s-custom-bentley-gt-continental---285-000><strong>Paris Hilton's Custom Bentley GT Continental - $285,000</strong></h2><p>Are you surprised that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Hilton</a> drives around in this all-pink custom Bentley GT Continental? We certainly aren't. Being a Hilton, the star probably received everything she wanted as a child, and now at the age of thirty-six, Paris is still living the good life and doing whatever the heck she wants to her cars even if it's throwing bright pink paint on her almost $300,000 luxury vehicle (we know there are a lot of people cringing right now). Let us also mention that every single part of the car is personalized with Hilton's very own signature, and there are pink leather seats and a pink dashboard, of course.</p><h2 id=p-diddy-s-son-justin-s-maybach---360-000><strong>P.Diddy's Son, Justin's Maybach - $360,000</strong></h2><p>When we finally got our driver's licenses, our parents allowed us to take their cars to the mall or hang out with friends. Some of our parents even bought us our first car, and while it may not have been anything special, it was still a car. However, if you're <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diddy</a>'s kid, you get the most expensive car when you turn sixteen. The rapper gifted his son with an insane $360,000 Maybach, but that wasn't all. Diddy threw his son a lavish sixteenth birthday party at a New York hotspot and, just in case Justin needed some cash, gave his son $10,000. Explaining why he gave his young son such a gift, he simply said, "I think it's appropriate to give my kids whatever I want to give my kids."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-beckham-s-rolls-royce-phantom-drophead---407-000><strong>David Beckham's Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead - $407,000</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Beckham</a> is one of the (if not THE) most well-known soccer player(s) in the world and certainly one of the wealthiest. Beckham is no stranger to having luxurious things, and one of his most precious items&nbsp;has to be this all-black Roll Royce Phantom Drophead that&nbsp;the soccer star bought in 2008. The car is estimated to cost a whopping $407,000. It was reported that David Beckham decided to get rid of the Rolls Royce and has since then bought numerous cars like the Porsche Turbo 911, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, and a Jaguar XJ, just to name a few. Would you get rid of such a car if your name was David Beckham?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-s-lamborghini-aventador---450-000><strong>Kylie Jenner's Lamborghini Aventador - $450,000</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a> is no stranger to buying expensive vehicles. One of her first cars was a Range Rover, and she was just sixteen years old. Last year, the reality star was photographed stepping out of her bright orange Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster in Los Angeles. The car comes at an insane price of $450,000, and Jenner can easily take off from the annoying paparazzi from zero to 62mph in as quick as 2.9 seconds. Jenner's car collection is pretty impressive, to say the least. The star also has a Rolls Royce Ghost, a Ferrari 458 Spider, as well as a custom Range Rover and the latest Mercedes G-Wagon G550 4x4.</p><h2 id=jay-leno-s-mercedes-slr-mclaren---500-000><strong>Jay Leno's Mercedes SLR McLaren - $500,000</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay Leno</a> cannot be beaten when it comes to collecting cars. The star literally had a television show based around the impressive cars in his gigantic car garage called Jay Leno's Garage. Leno owns approximately 286 vehicles (169 automobiles and 117 motorcycles), and we're pretty sure that number will just keep growing. One of his most luxurious rides in his garage is this Mercedes SLR McLaren that&nbsp;costs up to half a million dollars! In an episode of his show, Leno explained that the Mercedes was one of the best performance cars he's ever driven. The star also mentioned that the car comes close to matching the Porsche's Carrera GT around the ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicolas-cage-s-ferrari-enzo---670-000><strong>Nicolas Cage's Ferrari Enzo - $670,000</strong></h2><p>Before having to let go of his sweet ride because of various financial troubles, actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicolas Cage</a> was driving around in this $670,000 Ferrari Enzo in red. The car was first built in 2002 and caught many people's eye when it was featured in the film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, when actress <a href=#>Demi Moore</a> was driving it on the beach. It is one impressive car with a top speed of 221 mph. Unfortunately, Cage had to sell his sports car to pay off his taxes and other debts with some analysts believing that the star would have gotten about a million for his car. Ouch...</p><h2 id=jerry-seinfeld-s-porsche-959---700-000><strong>Jerry Seinfeld's Porsche 959 - $700,000</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Seinfeld</a> owns some sweet rides, and he's even had to let go of three of his beloved Porches, which sounds pretty absorb to us. In 2016, the actor put his Porsche 550 Spyder, 356 A 1500 GS/GT Carrera Speedster, and a 911 Carrera 3.0 IROC RSR at auction, and you can believe they didn't come cheap. He stated about giving away his cars, "I’ve never bought a car as an investment. I don’t really even think of myself as a collector. I just love cars. And I still love these cars. But it’s time to send some of them back into the world, for someone else to enjoy, as I have." However, the Porsche he did keep was his Porsche 959, which cost him a whopping $700,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kanye-west-s-lamborghini-aventador---750-000><strong>Kanye West's Lamborghini Aventador - $750,000</strong></h2><p>Just like his wife,&nbsp;Kim Kardashian West, rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> can treat himself to basically any car he desires. However, his matte black Lamborghini Aventador, costing a whopping $750,000, was actually a birthday gift from his baby mama. However, once Kim Kardashian&nbsp;fell pregnant with baby North, Kanye reportedly had to sell the car to make way for the new baby. It was reported that the rapper sold the beautiful car for over $400,000 and was replacing it with a Mercedes G63 AMG, which isn't too shabby either.</p><h2 id=steven-tyler-s-hennessey-venom-gt-spyder---1-1-million><strong>Steven Tyler's Hennessey Venom GT Spyder - $1.1 Million</strong></h2><p>The Aerosmith lead singer was reportedly the first person to own a Hennessey Venom GT Spyder and saw the car at its 2011 debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Tyler</a> was filming for American Idol later that year, Tyler asked for a test drive in the luxury vehicle and a few hours later, bought the insane $1.1 million ride. Hennessey built just five Venom GTs for the 2013 model year, which included the first Spyder. This gorgeous car can go from 0-60 in just 2.7 seconds. However, in 2017, Tyler sold the car in an auction for $800,000 but gave the money to Janie’s Fund, a charity Tyler set up to support abused girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=flo-rida-s-bugatti-veyron---1-7-million><strong>Flo Rida's Bugatti Veyron - $1.7 Million</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flo Rida</a> spares no expense when it comes to hot rods. The rapper purchased this Bugatti Veyron for an insane $1.7 million, but there was just one thing missing from his luxurious toy. The car, which is said to be the fastest in the world, was given a makeover. The 33-year-old, whose real name is Tramar Lacel Dillard, wrapped his million-dollar ride in gold. Even his cars rims are apparently believed to be 24-karat gold. The expensive car was originally white, but that was just way too boring of a color for Flo Rida. WrappedWorld stated, "Originally wrapped in chrome, Flor Rida decided to change it up and turn it into a Golden Gatti. The shoes on the Gold Gatti match the vinyl. Flo Rida's Bugatti is sitting on 24 inch, 24 karat gold Forgiato rims."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=simon-cowell-s-bugatti-veyron---1-7-million><strong>Simon Cowell's Bugatti Veyron - $1.7 Million</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Cowell</a> is another star that fell in love with the Bugatti Veyron. Anyone who loves a fast car wants this hot rod, but only a few people can actually shell out the $1.7 million for it. The Bugatti Veyron reaches speeds up to 260 miles per hour, and with an excess of 1000 horsepower, the car is specifically made for speed lovers. Cowell owned the car for four years, but we never saw the former American Idol judge really drive it around, and it was left mostly sitting in his garage. He finally decided to sell the car at an auction in Arizona but was reportedly going to lose a lot from what he initially paid for, with estimates of the car going for $800,000.</p><h2 id=50-cent-s-lamborghini-gallardo---2-million><strong>50 Cent's Lamborghini Gallardo - $2 Million</strong></h2><p>The Lamborghini Gallardo is another vehicle that is mainly known for its speed (and its price tag, of course). The car is Lamborghini's best-selling model and is named after a famous breed of fighting bulls. Despite having filed for bankruptcy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent</a> managed to have one of the most expensive cars on the market. The rapper owns the LP550-2 Super Trofeo version of the car, and the vehicle is reportedly very rare since it was actually made for the Hong Kong market and had to be imported to the United States.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=floyd-mayweather-s-koenigsegg-ccxr-trevita---4-8-million><strong>Floyd Mayweather's Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita - $4.8 Million</strong></h2><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather</a> isn't kicking someone's butt in the boxing ring, you can find him among his insane collection of expensive and rare cars. One of his cars is the Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita, which he bought for $4.8 million. According to one report, the fact that the car hit the market is a huge deal because there were only two of these vehicles built. The "Trevita" name is Swedish for "three whites," which is in reference to the Koenigsegg's special diamond-weave, carbon-fiber bodywork. Mayweather put the car up on auction, and since only two exist, you can believe there were probably a lot of high rollers trying to purchase the rare vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jay-z-s-maybach-exelero---8-million><strong>Jay-Z's Maybach Exelero - $8 Million</strong></h2><p>Beyonce's husband, rapper <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> owns the Maybach Exelero, and he bought it for a whopping $8 million. Jay-Z definitely looks like a boss in his ride and with a net worth of $550 million,&nbsp;he definitely IS a boss. The producer can afford this car with lots of ease and could probably own one or two more if he wanted. The Maybach Exelero is a two-seater coupe that can reach speeds of up to 200 mph. Kanye West and Jay-Z also featured the car in the music video “Otis.” It's reported that the rapper's car collection totals about $15 million! Wow...</p><h2 id=jay-leno-s-rolls-royce-silver-spur-limousine---14-million><strong>Jay Leno's&nbsp;Rolls-Royce Silver Spur Limousine - $14 Million</strong></h2><p>Of course, we had to feature another expensive car from Jay Leno's prestigious collection. With over 200 cars in his garage, Leno has probably the best collection of cars and motorcycles in the entire world. His collection varies from classic, contemporary, customized, and rare, and his $14 million Rolls Royce Silver Spur Limousine is one of his most luxurious and most expensive that he owns. You probably never saw a car like this before. The car is customized with 24-karat gold, and you can believe that Leno is not letting anyone go near it.

The collector, who isn't anyone necessarily famous, acquired the car in 1974, restored it, and even drove it in many historic races, including the 2002 Le Mans Classic.
