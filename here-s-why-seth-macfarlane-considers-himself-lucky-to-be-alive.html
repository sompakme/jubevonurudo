may seem <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">difficult to picture late-night television without the Griffin family </a>and their off-color adventures. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The popular comedy program</a>, however, was a couple of drinks and a typo away from being a two-season hit. The reason? The show’s creator Seth MacFarlane almost died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans have been wondering</a> what would have come of MacFarlane’s cartoon empire if he had not made it. And what would Fox even air if not for&nbsp;Family Guy or his other big hit&nbsp;American Dad?</p><p>We have taken some time to break down how exactly MacFarlane escaped death on that fateful day in 2001 and why the event continues to be relevant to his best television creations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Much Mila Kunis Makes Voicing Meg Griffin On ‘Family Guy’</a></span></p><h2 id=saved-by-the-bar>Saved&nbsp;By The...Bar?</h2><p>MacFarlane’s escape from death was such a close-call that the show creator admits that he was actually saved by his own disorganization. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with CNN’s Piers Morgan</a>, MacFarlane revealed that he was scheduled to fly on American Airlines Flight 11–which crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center. However, a hangover and a slight clerical error were enough to make him miss the flight by about ten minutes. According to MacFarlane, it was only minutes later that he found himself in the airport lounge watching his flight go down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was giving a lecture at my college the night before and went out with some of the faculty afterwards, and I had a few pints...and my travel agent had listed the flight on my itinerary as leaving ten minutes later than it did...That was the flight I was supposed to be on. I was late.&nbsp;I missed it,” MacFarlane told Morgan.</p><p>How did the experience change MacFarlane’s life view? According to the man&nbsp;behind the cartoon, the answer is: ‘not much.’</p><p>The show creator told Morgan, “I am not a fatalist. I was not shaken to the core in the way that I changed my whole outlook on life. Mainly because I had missed planes before, and coincidences do happen.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Basically, MacFarlane sees his escape from death—and the survival of&nbsp;Family Guy along with it—as nothing more than a lucky accident.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Guy: 20 Fan Designs Better Than The Actual Characters</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=9-11-references-in-family-guy>9/11 References In&nbsp;Family Guy</h2><p>Even though MacFarlane does not consider his 9/11 experience to be indicative of destiny, he does believe that if he had boarded that flight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his shows would&nbsp;have died along with him</a>. The cartoon creator was not afraid to express this line of thought in a&nbsp;Family Guy&nbsp;episode in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian and Stewie reveal that they are lucky to be alive</a>.</p><p>Brian tells Stewie, “you know, I was supposed to be on one of those planes.”</p><p>Without hesitation, Stewie replies, “yeah, me too.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The scene alludes to the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MacFarlane does the voice acting</a> for many of the show’s major characters, including both Brian and Stewie. Without MacFarlane, it is difficult to imagine that&nbsp;Family Guy&nbsp;would still exist as anything more than a handful of reruns.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Seth MacFarlane Thought Trump Was Boring At His Roast</a></span></p><h2 id=how-far-is-too-far>How Far Is Too Far?</h2><p>Over the years, MacFarlane has taken the show’s 9/11 references and drawn them out well past a short scene or two. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One episode</a> actually went so far as to imagine an alternate universe in which Brian and Stewie traveled through time and prevented the attacks. Some fans, however, have felt that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MacFarlane’s cartoon representations</a> of terrorism have gone too far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Rove LA</a>, MacFarlane opened up about the controversy surrounding his 9/11 alternate universe episode. According to the creator, viewers may have missed the point he was trying to make. Apparently, the episode was supposed to be about the unknown dangers of time travel and not the actual events of the terror attacks themselves.</p><p>“Within the context of the episode, Brian and Stewie go back to the pilot episode of&nbsp;Family Guy,&nbsp;which aired in 1999. And they go back in time for other reasons, and while he’s there, Brian tells (his past self) about 9/11...the moral of the episode is that you should not tamper with the past,” MacFarlane revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the show’s creator clearly felt justified in his portrayal of events, not everyone agreed.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly&nbsp;</a>wrote a scathing review of the episode, arguing that&nbsp;Family Guy&nbsp;knows no bounds when it comes to mocking terrible events: “in the grand scheme of&nbsp;Family Guy- which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has joked about everything</a> from the Holocaust to domestic abuse -is this simply par for the course?”</p><p>So, will MacFarlane stop referencing 9/11 in his shows?</p><p>The short answer is: no. When asked to defend his controversial episode on Rove LA, MacFarlane replied, “it’s ridiculous. It’s a ridiculous discussion. But let’s f***ing have it!”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Guy: 16 Wild Revelations About Peter And Lois’ Relationship</a>&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmqp6smGK6oq%2FFmqmlmZ6aeqS7zaygnZ2iqHqptcysnKWeXaHCpLfYZquoZZKaeqK4yK%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nacre-victorie-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nacre Victorie Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
