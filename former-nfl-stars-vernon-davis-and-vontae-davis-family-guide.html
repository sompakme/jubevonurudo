The authorities accused a then-19-year-old Michael of killing 66-year-old <strong>Gary Dederichs</strong> by hitting him on the head with a hammer. Michael was also suspected of being involved in three similar attacks, which he was never charged for.</p><p>Michael was arrested on two charges of assault with intent to kill while armed.

We grew up in a three-bedroom home in Washington, DC. My mom was always on drugs. My dad was never around,” he told the Daily Mail. “My mom and my dad never came to a football game as a kid.”</p><p>Vontae, meanwhile, shared photos of his grandmother on social media over the years.
