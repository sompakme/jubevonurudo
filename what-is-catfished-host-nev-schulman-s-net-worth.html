The pair adventured far and wide to source the most shocking catfish tales, which the Catfish audience has undoubtedly come to love and adore, tuning in on a regular basis to lap up the unfolding drama.</p><p>After Max's departure at the end of Season 7, Nev partnered up with new and current co-host, American-born Kamie Crawford.</p><h2 id=how-much-has-nev-schulman-made-from-hosting-mtv-rsquo-s-catfish>How Much Has Nev Schulman Made From Hosting MTV’s Catfish?</h2><p>Catfish host Nev Schulman has been on the show for all 8 seasons, with <a href=#>filming commencing when Nev was just 26 years old</a>. As the series has flourished since first hitting screens, fans are curious to know how much the American TV star has made.</p><p>Reportedly Nev Schulman <a href=#>earns an estimated $100,000 dollars for each episode</a> of Catfish he does, bringing in an estimated $1.6 million dollars by the end of a 16-episode stint. Not too shabby!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nev has previously <a href=#>stated on Reddit that he wants the show to carry a good message</a>, and show and emphasized 'the importance of the stories of the people, and the choices they are making, and the issues they are dealing with'. This is perhaps one of the contributing reasons why fans have fallen in love with the show so much - aside from the juicy drama that keeps them hooked!</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=# title="Everything We Know About 'Catfish' Host Nev Schulman's Life">Everything We Know About 'Catfish' Host Nev Schulman's Life</a></span></p><h2 id=what-other-shows-has-nev-schulman-been-in>What Other Shows Has Nev Schulman Been In?</h2><p>Besides being a full-time catfish hunter, Nev has also starred in some other roles as part of his career. He appeared in Nobody's Fool, a romantic comedy film released in 2018, playing himself together with Max. He also competed on the 19th season of Dancing With The Stars, where he managed to land himself in second place with his dance partner Jenna Johnson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2010, Schulman was also part of the documentary Catfish. The film showcased his own very personal catfish tale, in which Nev fell in love with a woman he met online, only to later realize that she wasn't who she said she was. Ironically, he had in fact been catfished. This experience is one of the reasons why Nev can relate so much to the people who star on the MTV show, as he knows the emotional turmoil they have felt. However, it was thanks to this experience that he has now been able to dabble his hand at fame.</p><p><strong><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Max Joseph Quit ‘Catfish’">The Real Reason Max Joseph Quit ‘Catfish’</a></span></strong></p><h2 id=what-is-lsquo-catfished-rsquo-host-nev-schulman-rsquo-s-net-worth>What Is ‘Catfished’ Host Nev Schulman’s Net Worth?</h2><p>Nev Schulman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has a net worth of $2 million US dollars</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Much of this of course is contributed to his work on MTV's Catfish, which pays around $100,000 an episode. However as the show has grown in popularity, this figure may well have increased over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However this is not his only source of income, Schulman also charges for public appearances and speeches. According to The List, he charges around $50,000 to $100,000 for either of these options. This is a sizeable amount of income when combined with his earnings from Catfish.</p><p>In addition, we can also add his winnings from his second-place victory on Dancing With The Stars. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety reported that he earned $125,000 for the rehearsal period</a> and for each extra week the contestants stay on, additional money is earned. Again, this adds a hefty amount to Nev's money pot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schulman has also ventured into other territories, writing a book in 2014 named 'In Real Life: Love, Lies & Identity in the Digital Age' which sells for $16 per copy on Amazon. The book dives into one of Nev's most knowledgeable topics - catfishing. He openly discusses his personal stories about relationships and dating, whilst also shining much focus onto online dating and catfishing.</p><p>Seeing as he's had plenty of experience in this domain, it's highly likely the book is filled with knowledgeable information and perhaps even relatable advice. His earnings from the book, which currently remain undisclosed, will again of contributed to his $2 million net worth.</p><p><strong><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Catfish: 10 Times Nev And Max Were Tricked">Catfish: 10 Times Nev And Max Were Tricked</a></span></strong></p><h2 id=how-much-does-his-catfish-co-star-kamie-crawford-make-from-catfish>How Much Does His Catfish Co-Star Kamie Crawford Make From Catfish?</h2><p>According to The List, Catfish host and co-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamie Crawford makes approximately $100,000 per episode</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, we can presume that Kamie takes home well over a million each season, as each season contains a total of 16 episodes.
