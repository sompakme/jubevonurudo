Rachel on NBC's hit show,&nbsp;Friends.&nbsp;Since then, she's kept herself in amazing shape thanks to her consistency in diet and her rigorous workout plan. Though she's been asked throughout the past couple decades to give the public advice on keeping a healthy and toned body, she's been questioned more on her image in the past few months than ever before. In June 2016, Jen made headlines for an essay she had published in the Huffington Post. In it she expressed her exhaustion over the 24/7 paparazzi agents that lurk, waiting for her to emerge from her home in Bel Air.</p><p>"If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues," wrote Jennifer. The following year, in 2017, Jen started publicly condemning those who body&nbsp;shame women in Hollywood, and women in general. She started talking about the things she does to maintain a healthy lifestyle as means to encourage her female following without shaming them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her exercise tips are inspiring, yet manageable; her diet tips are strict, yet still enjoyable; and her beauty tips aren't unreasonable at all. Jen refuses to get any kind of cosmetic&nbsp;enhancements and invites other women into that same resolve. Everyone should know that they're beautiful just the way&nbsp;they are.&nbsp;However, if you've always wondered how Jennifer looks 25 at age at 48-years-old, here are all of her secrets unfolded for you to follow.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-s-slimming-swaps>Jennifer Aniston's "Slimming Swaps"</h2><p>One of the toughest things about losing weight is putting down the snack foods. If you're used to munching on something sweet or salty, or something both sweet and salty throughout your day, you should consider using <a href=#>Jen</a>'s tip so you can start seeing progress.</p><p>Jen let&nbsp;Access Hollywood&nbsp;in on one of her secrets back in 2015. She dubbed it "slimming swaps." Slimming swaps are when you make the decision to trade your bag of potato chips for kale chips. If you have to satisfy that salt craving, there are better ways. The same goes for sweets. Trade your candy bar in for fresh or dried fruit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jen loves carbs, so her favorite slimming swap is pastries for brown-rice bread: "I love brown-rice bread. It's really good for you. Just put a little coconut oil and sea salt on top. Delicious.” That does actually sound good.</p><h2 id=no-excuses-ever>No Excuses&nbsp;– Ever</h2><p>If anyone should be allowed to have excuses to not workout, it would be Jennifer Aniston. She travels much more than the rest of us, yet still gets in her workouts no matter what. Each time she travels, she packs her Mandy Ingber exercise DVD and a set of eight-pound weights. Once she lands, she makes it a habit to go on a 30-minute run. If not in the mood for her hotel gym, she'll throw on a disguise and go outside.</p><p>When she travels alone, she'll do small exercises when hanging out in her hotel room. "It's always good to do arm exercises when you're watching television or talking on the phone. I also love to stretch before I go to bed, and usually throw in a couple of sit-ups," Jennifer told InStyle.&nbsp;Let her be an example to us all. There are never really any excuses&nbsp;– ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-jennifer-eats-for-breakfast>What Jennifer Eats For Breakfast</h2><p>In a recent interview with Bon Appetit, Jen broke down her breakfast routine for us. Before deciding on what to eat, she drinks a cup of hot water with lemon, which helps to flush her digestive track before the day's meals. For breakfast, Jen&nbsp;sticks to one of three options: a superfood smoothie, eggs with avocado toast, or oatmeal.</p><p>If she chooses it's a smoothie day, she'll mix in fruit, protein powder, nuts to naturally sweeten it, and almond milk. "Then there are all sorts of other weird antioxidant stuff I can’t remember,” said Jen. When she goes with eggs, she only makes two and puts them on top of toast with a healthy avocado spread.</p><p>If it's an oatmeal day, Jen sprinkles chia seeds or flax seeds in, which are packed with omega-3s that help the body function better in general. "Justin [Theroux], my husband, taught me that little move to get extra protein! Right before [the oatmeal] is finished cooking, you just whip in an egg white and it kind of gives it this fluffy texture that's delicious." Great advice all around, Jen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-jennifer-eats-for-lunch>What Jennifer Eats For Lunch</h2><p>For lunch, Jen makes sure she eats greens and a protein. Usually that means a salad with chicken or tofu. On February 21, 2016, NBC released a special,&nbsp;Must See TV: An All-Star Tribute to James Burrows. The cast of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;gathered to offer praise to their director, but also decided to share some behind-the-scenes secrets about their ten years together. During the segment, <a href=#>Courteney Cox</a> mentioned that she, <a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a>, and Jennifer Aniston ate lunch together almost every day for nearly a decade.</p><p>"We ate the same food: a Jennifer salad," said Cox. What is in the Jennifer salad? Well, "It's a twist on a Cobb, with garbanzo beans added, and turkey bacon instead of regular bacon." Jennifer later showed Living Proof how to make her favorite salad: "You add bulgur, cucumbers, parsley, mint, red onion, garbanzo beans, feta cheese,&nbsp;and pistachios." Yum.</p><h2 id=what-jennifer-eats-for-dinner>What Jennifer Eats For Dinner</h2><p>Jen tries to stay away from carbs, but that's been difficult to do since her husband is such a carb lover. For dinner, she makes a bowl of spiraled zucchini noodles that she pours pesto sauce over. Then every couple of weeks, her husband Justin makes them pasta carbonara. "It’s just an egg, parmesan cheese, and a little pasta water. And we substitute turkey bacon for real bacon, so, you know," said Jen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jen's philosophy on health in a nutshell: “It’s pretty clear. Eat as much organic fruits and veggies as you can, keep sugar [intake] low, drink tons and tons of water, and get good sleep.” Jen keeps her starches to a minimum and avoids all "white" foods.&nbsp;Didn't your mother teach you&nbsp;that "the whiter the bread, the sooner you're dead?"</p><h2 id=what-jennifer-s-cheat-days-look-like>What Jennifer's Cheat Days Look Like</h2><p>Jennifer does have a few guilty pleasures that she allows herself to munch on one day a week, just usually not the day she isn't working out. She starts her day off with a cup of coffee but tries to keep the sugar low. Her favorite thing in the world is fluffy tortilla chips. She makes them herself and keeps them on hand. She also loves Mexican food. (Let's be real, tacos should be in everybody's life.)</p><p>When it comes to sweets, Jen regularly eats frozen yogurt, but always stays away from cakes. When entertaining, Jen and hubby make a large batch of vegetable lasagna: "You have zucchini, eggplant that acts as a paste, and you layer it with different cheeses and put it in the oven. It's an easy group meal."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-yoga-is-so-important-according-to-jen>Why Yoga Is So Important, According To Jen</h2><p>After filming Wanderlust,&nbsp;people started to take notice of Jen's extra tightened body. That's when she first started sharing her yoga routine with us and why it's so crucial to her lifestyle. Jen follows Ingber’s Yogolosophy program. Each day she performs "sun salutes," which begin in a mountain pose, falling into a plank and then back into mountain pose. She daily practices the "tree pose," which helps bring balance and tone up each leg. She also does the "chair pose," squats, and "boat pose" reps to work her abs. There are many other poses involved in Ingber's Yogolosophy which&nbsp;put a twist on yoga poses to maximize tone.</p><p>Another thing Jennifer mentions often in interviews is her breathing technique, which she picked up from trainer Mark Blanchard, creator of <i>The Sedona Experience.&nbsp;</i>"Inhaling and exhaling evenly and completely makes any workout more effective by bringing extra oxygen to your muscles. Aim for about 12 inhalations and exhalations per minute," says Blanchard.</p><h2 id=jennifer-s-reasons-for-endorsing-the-zone-diet>Jennifer's Reasons For Endorsing "The Zone Diet"</h2><p>Before getting into Jen's reasons for endorsing The Zone Diet, you have to know what it even is. The Zone Diet isn't about "low carbs" or low anything, for that matter.&nbsp;It's about balance, which Jen is a fan of. It focuses on lean natural meats, low glycemic fruits and veggies, and healthy fats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The balance is 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 30% fat. Eating this way keeps your body in "the zone" by keeping inflammation producing hormones at bay. Jen decided to endorse the diet because she doesn't like to promote methods for "losing weight fast." She actually eats a lot and isn't after quick fixes. Essentially on this diet, sugar, breads and pasta are reduced and fruits, veggies and lean meats become the focus. It's similar to The Mediterranean Diet.</p><h2 id=getting-past-the-i-don-t-want-to-work-out-phase>Getting Past The "I Don't Want To Work Out" Phase</h2><p>When Jen first started establishing her workout routine, she said she'd get bored and not want to finish. She'd also get sore and not be able to continue. (Most of us can definitely relate to the latter.) "10 minutes a day is all it takes at first. Push through," says Jen.</p><p>As a beginner, start slow. 10 mins a day is doable. Then increase to 15 minutes, then 20 minutes, then 30 minutes, until you're up to an hour. (More than that is excessive, according to Jen.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starting slow is the only way to get past the "I don't want to work out" phase. When People asked Jen to address claims that she works out excessively, multiple times a day, she simply laughed and said, "Oh, that’s not true. Oh my God, no way! About an hour a day. And I usually take Sundays off." There you have it. Totally manageable.</p><h2 id=how-to-embrace-aging-according-to-jen>How To Embrace Aging, According To Jen</h2><p>Hollywood is full of faces that are extremely enhanced. Celebs start&nbsp;changing their bodies in their 20s (just look at <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>). Jen doesn't believe in them and she's quite&nbsp;boisterous about it.</p><p>“There is this pressure in Hollywood to be ageless. I think what I have been witness to is women trying to stay ageless with what they are doing to themselves. I am grateful to learn from their mistakes, because I am not injecting [stuff] into my face. I see them and my heart breaks. I think ‘Oh god, if you only know how much older you look.’ They are trying to stop the clock, and all you can see is an insecure person who won’t let themselves just age," Jen told People.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A good diet, lots of water, good rest, massages and creams is what Jen recommends. She also mentions laser therapy that tightens up the muscles. But there's also a gene factor to Jen's youthful appearance. Her father is 100% Greek. When he passed he had "barely one wrinkle," said Jen. And as much as Jen loves the sun, she's had to learn how to limit herself. It's never good for the skin.</p><h2 id=jennifer-s-cardio-routine>Jennifer's Cardio Routine</h2><p>Jens cardio routine is simple: "I use my elliptical. I raise the incline, run for two minutes, walk for one, run for two... and I do it for 20 minutes straight until I’m just drenched," she told Vogue. Interval training is better than having a straight, mindless cardio routine. It also helps to preserve the joints, which is important as we age.</p><p>Here's a tip that Jen uses for her elliptical training: "Your core should remain relatively still while your arms and legs move. Imagine there is a glass ceiling above your head —a s soon as you do that you will feel your stomach, back, and glutes engage in a totally different way," says one of her trainers, Amelia DiDomenico. When Jen is out of town, she finds a machine to work out on, but usually is working out at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tips-from-jen-s-trainer>Tips From Jen's Trainer</h2><p>Kathy Kaehler is trainer to Jennifer Aniston, <a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a> and <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>. Kathy was an athlete all of her life, then started training friends for fun in her middle age, which led to it becoming her profession. She's known among A-list celebs as one of the "go-to" trainers for middle-aged actresses.</p><p>Here are some of Kathy's tips: Firstly, walking after every meal is important for digestion. (Kathy walks 15 minutes after each meal.) Secondly, the best way to burn fat is actually not cardio, but weight-lifting. It revs up your metabolism. Thirdly, make sure you don't get stuck in a rut. A variety of exercise is important. Furthermore, remember the saying "Use it, or lose it." Do something physical every single day to stay out of the risk zone for certain diseases. Lastly, make sure to always take one day a week to rest. That is some great advice right there, Kathy.</p><h2 id=jennifer-s-stretching-and-toning-exercises>Jennifer's Stretching And Toning Exercises</h2><p>Jennifer works out with her trainer three days a week. Jen and her trainer start off with 20 minutes of cardio and then go into a 45-minute yoga routine. Their cardio consists of spinning and their yoga routine is taken from Yogalosophy apps and DVDs. "Jen likes planking, because planks work with the abs,&nbsp; or the forearm plank&nbsp;– any variation of the plank or the forearm plank."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer and Kathy always end their sessions in meditation, a 5-minute shavashana to be exact. "Set the timer, close your eyes, sit straight up in a chair, both feet flat on the floor, and put your attention on your breath and do your best," says Kathy. A wandering mind is natural when you meditate. Just keep bringing your attention back to your breath. "Meditation is like a muscle. Ingber's Yogalosophy promises that you will be more productive if you start setting aside five minutes to practice a day," says Kathy.</p><h2 id=jen-s-tips-for-healthier-skin>Jen's&nbsp;Tips For Healthier Skin</h2><p>When it comes to skincare, Jen has quite a few tips for us: Instead of paralyzing your facial muscles, stimulate them. An aesthetician can place charged pads on your face to stimulate the muscles. Those muscles immediately tighten and tone your skin. The procedure only takes five minutes. To target wrinkles, Jen practices Thermage, which uses radiofrequency waves to stimulate collagen.</p><p>She also advises others to wear less makeup. Less makeup makes older women look younger. When you do wear it, keep your colors light. Ditch the eyeliner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is also a huge fan of sunscreen – lots of it. Soaking yourself in sunscreen does so much to stop the aging process. Also, people should try to limit&nbsp;– if not remove entirely&nbsp;– dairy and gluten for healthier skin. Think about what true beauty looks like. If you know what matters, you'll shine. These are such great tips. We'll definitely be implementing them right away.</p><h2 id=workout-classes-jen-recommends>Workout Classes Jen Recommends</h2><p>We've already established this, but interval training on the elliptical machine is Jen's top choice. Next would be spin classes, which she takes three times a week. Jen also recommends a yoga bootcamp called "The Class," instructed Taryn Toomey.</p><p>"I feel really beautiful when I finish a great workout. Because I’ve taken care of my body, my endorphins are going, my blood is pumping. I’m taking care of the one body I have," said Jen to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Jennifer Aniston does, of course, have an incredible body, but I think part of what people respond to with her is that she seems very comfortable in her own skin; she seems healthy and holistic&nbsp;and obviously that comes from more than just being active. It comes from working on both the body and the mind, "said Mandy Ingber, Jen's yoga coach.</p><h2 id=what-jen-grows-in-her-backyard>What Jen Grows In Her Backyard</h2><p>Jen and her husband Justin bought a $21 million dollar estate in Bel Air, California last year. They added a vineyard, library, vegetable garden, and gym for an extra $6 million. Of all her estate has to offer, Jen's pride and joy is the 8,500-square-foot chicken coop nestled under her trees. Jen had a miniature Taj Mahal built for her chicks and loves to visit them each morning. ‘They're very social animals and they like it when you visit them with a cup of coffee in your hand. According to my groundskeeper, they love pasta," Jen told The Globe.</p><p>Jen claims it's the raw eggs she's after and that she wouldn't harm her chicks.&nbsp; "We attempted to [name our chickens], but there are 17 of them now. We did get two baby chicks as a gift named Justin and Jen. I've lost track because they all look alike," Jen told InStyle. "We use the eggs every day. We make frittatas, carbonara. Justin makes great pasta. I use the eggs in my salad or for snacks. They taste delicious!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-don-t-like-it-quit-it>"You Don't Like It, Quit It"</h2><p>Jen isn't okay with being forced to do anything. She enjoys working out because they are workouts of her choosing, and they are workouts that she's passionate about. The same goes for you and I. Jen wants her fans to know that if you don't like something you're trying, you have the right to ditch it. There is always something better fit to you that will make you happier and yield the same results.</p><p>"I kind of stay with more simple stuff," says Jen. "I enjoy life a little bit more then." Amen to that. Unless bootcamp style workouts are what get you hyped, of course. The bottom line: do what makes you happy, as long as it's keeping you healthy. Jen's trainer suggests nature walks, hikes, swims and dance classes, for women who don't like typical workouts or for women who like to stay outdoors.</p><h2 id=everybody-needs-accountability>Everybody Needs Accountability</h2><p>Jennifer's accountability consists of her personal trainer,&nbsp;her yoga instructor, and her girlfriends. Courteney Cox is still really close to Jennifer. The two meditate and practice yoga together all the time. Jen claims that the key to success in exercise is keeping accountability. That could be said for all things, whether it be your career, past-times or personal issues. Voicing your goals to another person can make them more possible to accomplish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jen stresses that women who have been working out for years without missing a day especially need accountability to keep pushing them along and to new heights. Here are five quick tips to improve your accountability.&nbsp;Firstly, hire a trainer or sign up for a class. Secondly, write out your schedule and sync it to all of your devices. Another good idea is to find a workout buddy to help motivate you on your lazy days. She also recommends packing up your workout stuff the night before and set it by the door. Lastly, she advises others to set aside rewards at the end of each week for extra motivation.</p><h2 id=the-most-severe-transformation-jen-s-had-to-endure>The Most Severe Transformation Jen's Had To Endure</h2><p>The most severe body transformation Jen has had to make for a movie was when she played Claire Simmons in Cake.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's rarely had to shed weight for a role, but in this flick she actually had to gain it. In order to do so, Jen stopped working out for two and a half months, and it was dreadful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nobody knows how much she actually gained for the role, but it was enough to cause a tabloid stir. The paparazzi started spreading rumors that Jen was expecting, which infuriated her and caused her to comment to the Huffington Post, "Since I’m not on social media, I decided to put my thoughts here in writing. For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment' and 'celebrity news.'"</p><h2 id=jennifer-talks-water>Jennifer Talks Water</h2><p>Jennifer joined in on an ad campaign for Smartwater in June of last year, but she's been a spokeswoman for the brand since 2007. Before Smartwater approached Jen with the idea, she was already drinking four bottles a day as part of her health routine. "I love it and I crave it," said Jen, so joining in on the campaign was a no-brainer. It's already a deep conviction of hers and a practice she wants to see others adopt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Water is Jen's number one answer for everything. For skin, weight loss, gut health and anti-aging techniques, Jen recommends water. She believes in Smartwater so much that she made an exception to her "no social media" rule by allowing photos to be taken of her for an ad campaign that targeted only Instagram users.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZraF2srrq%2FjKOcp6aZm7KzecCnoKysn6N6tMDAsqpmoZ5iwKmtz55kn6Gko7K0v4yapZ1llJ6ytXnToqesZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./adamari-lopez-net-worth-how-much-is-lopez-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Adamari Lopez Net Worth How Much is Lopez Worth?</a>
