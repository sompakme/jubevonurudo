There were tons of unique offerings that weren’t afraid to push the envelope, and shows like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jersey Shore</a> rose to prominence during that time. Sandwiched between those shows was&nbsp;The Girls Next Door, which focused on life at the Playboy Mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holly Madison, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendra Wilkinson</a>, and Bridget Marquardt were the original Playmates on the show, and they have done well for themselves through the years. Fans, however, have wondered where they stack up in terms of net worth since the show came to an end.</p><p>Let’s see which of the original&nbsp;Girls Next Door Playmates has the highest net worth.</p><h2 id=holly-madison-is-number-one-with-16-million>Holly Madison Is Number One With $16 Million</h2><p>Fans of The&nbsp;Girls Next Door&nbsp;were in for quite a surprise when the show debuted, as they quickly learned that things were done a bit differently in the Playboy Mansion. Mogul Hugh Hefner had multiple girlfriends that he lived with, and Holly Madison was the one closest to the man himself. Over time, Madison has worked to take her net worth to a whopping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$16 million</a>.</p><p>Prior to becoming a household name on the show, Madison had done some modeling, but her big break came when she linked up with Hefner and became a Playmate. Being featured on the show opened up loads of opportunities for Madison, who was able to gain mainstream exposure while expanding her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Girls Next Door kicked off in 2005, and from there, Madison started being featured in other projects. Through the years, she has appeared in projects like&nbsp;Robot Chicken, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Chelsea Lately,&nbsp;and even&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars. She even landed a guest role on an episode of&nbsp;CSI&nbsp;and had her own reality show.</p><p>Madison has done film work with roles in&nbsp;Scary Movie 4, The House Bunny,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sharknado 3. In recent years, the former Playmate made waves when she released her memoir and clued people into what life was really like behind the scenes at the Playboy Mansion. That memoir is soon to be turned into a limited series, so fans will certainly be tuning in to see what really went down.</p><p>$16 million is quite impressive, but Madison isn’t the only former cast member with a solid net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cody Simpson Spends Time With A Playboy Model And Miley Cyrus Posts Sad Songs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendra-wilkinson-is-next-up-with-6-million>Kendra Wilkinson Is Next Up With $6 Million</h2><p>The Girls Next Door fans will certainly remember what Kendra brought to the table as the youngest of the primary cast. She was still 19 when filming began, and she quickly took center stage and turned into perhaps the most popular Playmate that was actually featured on the show. As it stands now, the former Playmate has a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 million</a>.</p><p>Much like Madison, plenty of doors opened up for Wilkinson thanks to appearing on the show. Being one of the most popular members of the cast was certainly a bonus for the young star, and she made plenty of headlines during her time on the show.</p><p>Wilkinson would go on to land roles in projects like&nbsp;General Hospital, Scary Movie V,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Mindy Project over the years. Much like Madison, she has also appeared on a number of other programs as herself, effectively keeping her name in the headlines. Aside from appearing on other shows, Kendra proved to be popular enough to star on her own reality show,&nbsp;Kendra on Top. Prior to this, she also starred on her own reality show from 2009 to 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holly and Kendra may be leading the pack here, but the last Playmate from the original cast has plenty to brag about.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playboy Model Ashley Mattingly Dead At Age 33, Her Family Speaks Out</a></span></p><h2 id=bridget-marquardt-rounds-things-out-with-4-million>Bridget Marquardt Rounds Things Out With $4 Million</h2><p>Bridget Marquardt may have been a bit older when compared to some of the other Playmates on the show, but people loved the realness and honesty that she brought to the table. Sure, Wilkinson was more popular, but everyone enjoyed Bridget on&nbsp;The Girls Next Door. The former Playmate is currently sporting a net worth of $4 million, which is just shy of what Wilkinson has.</p><p>Compared to Madison and Wilkinson, Marquardt has not been nearly as busy in film and television projects playing characters. She has appeared on shows as herself plenty of times through the years, but she has not been one to flex her acting abilities on a consistent basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One awesome thing that Bridget has going for her these days is her podcast,&nbsp;Ghost Magnet, which taps into her love of the supernatural. She was vocal about this while she was on the show, and over time, she has been able to pursue her passion and make money while doing so.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Kendra Wilkinson Done Since Leaving The Playboy Mansion?</a></span></p><p>The Girls Next Door was a huge success while it was on television, and the original girls are continuing to thrive financially.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian Mimics Nancy Gould's 'Playboy' Cover...
