Since Big Ed made taco pasta that was too spicy for Woods' daughter, that spawned a fight between the couple that led to their split.</p><p>In May 2024, Big Ed appeared on Page Six's "Virtual Reali-Tea" podcast to discuss his and Woods' latest breakup. During the resulting conversation, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Ed revealed he was dating someone new</a></strong>.

However, Big Ed explained that finding a good partner is difficult. “I have a lot of people that pursue me that want that and that honestly is the hardest part for me to be able to meet somebody.”</p><p>However, according to what Big Ed said during the podcast appearance, <strong>the new woman in his life isn't interested in his fame</strong>.</p><p>"And she wants nothing to do with my fame or whatever.

"I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say 'I'm sorry' like it's always been. I call, I apologize, OK, and we move on. And that's how the last 14 breakups have been."</p><p>Based on what Woods said, she didn't even really understand <strong>why Big Ed canceled their wedding</strong>. As a result, the only sense of the situation that Woods could make at the time was that <strong>Big Ed got cold feet</strong>.</p><p>“The only thing I can think of is Ed's getting cold feet and he never actually really wanted to get married because although we've been the best we've ever been, we still have our issues.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydo2KvqrOMnptmppWserOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIyloLNlp6S8pb%2BMm6memZtiwrF7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./carl-nassib-net-worth-how-much-is-nassib-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Carl Nassib Net Worth How Much is Nassib Worth?</a>
