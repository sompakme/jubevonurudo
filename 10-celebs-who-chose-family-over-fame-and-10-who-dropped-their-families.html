All they care about is being the best at what they do and being world famous for it. They also want all the benefits that come with being a celebrity. They want the money, the lavish mansion and the fleet of cars. They want to be the star on the red carpet with an even more famous celeb hanging off their arm. They want the endorsement deals and their own merchandise line. They dream&nbsp;of starring in all the biggest movies and television shows. Some celebs sacrifice everything to achieve their goals and the fame is far more important than family. However, other celebs dream of having a family and living a normal life.</p><p>There are many celebs that put their careers over everything including their own families. Fame is the most important thing in their life and they never want to lose it. In fact, even when they start a family they quickly go back to focusing on the fame and fortune. On the other hand, there are a number of celebs that have given up careers for their family. Here is a look at 10 Celebs Who Chose Family Over Fame (And 10 Who Dropped Their Families).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dropped---charlie-sheen><strong>Dropped - Charlie Sheen</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Sheen</a> is one of the most recognizable celebrity names in the world. At one time he was the highest paid actor on TV. He is best known for starring&nbsp;in the sitcom Two and a Half Men. He left the series after having a very public feud with the series creator. He starred in several memorable films, including, Platoon, Wall Street, and Major League.</p><p>Sheen is also known for loving the wild partying lifestyle and everything that comes with it. That includes the women, money, and the partying. In 2002, Sheen married actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Denise Richards</a> and together they have two kids. They divorced in 2006 due to Sheen becoming scary, and his&nbsp;various problems. In 2008, he married his third wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke Mueller</a> and they have twin sons together. They divorced due to Sheen’s volatile and out of control behavior. Despite being married twice he couldn’t give up the women and the partying. He is infamously known for his love to party all night long. He spent some time in rehab but continues to struggle with his personal demons. Many celebs give up the Hollywood lifestyle to focus on their wife and kids. Sheen tried to do it twice but the fame and fortune apparently is just too much for him to give up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=family-over-fame---candace-cameron-bure><strong>Family Over Fame -&nbsp;</strong><strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Candace Cameron Bure</a> first rose to fame with her role as D.J. Tanner in the popular sitcom Full House. After the series concluded, she chose to step away from the spotlight to focus on her family. In 1996, she married retired hockey player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Valeri Bure</a>. They have three children and both focus on raising a family. She rarely made any film or TV appearances aside from a few guest roles. In 2014, she returned to acting to portray Aurora Teagarden in the Hallmark made for TV movie mystery series. In 2016, she returned to the role of D.J. Tanner for the Netflix series Fuller House. She then became a co-host on the morning talk show The View.</p><p>However, her family is always her first priority and she will give up lucrative opportunities for them. Her husband and kids are the center of her world and she won’t let anything get in the way of that. She decided to leave The View to spend more time with her family. She said, “The commute of going West Coast to East Coast every single week for me has been tough on me and hard for my family as well and I want to make sure that I'm able to spend as much time with my children and invest in all the projects that I do to the fullest extent.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dropped---scarlett-johansson><strong>Dropped - Scarlett Johansson&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlett Johansson</a> is known all over the world. She is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood. She starred in several memorable films, such as The Horse Whisperer, Lost in Translation and The Prestige. She currently portrays Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She is one of the most in demand stars in Hollywood.</p><p>Her mother, Melanie Sloan, began taking Johansson to auditions from a very young age. She eventually became her manager and guided her career. However, it was clear that Sloan was far more interested in fame and fortune than the well being of her daughter. She relied financially on Johansson who eventually was fed up with her mother.</p><p><strong>In 2009, Johansson fired Sloan as her manager and signed on with new management. According to the New York Daily News, “Johansson had tired of being her mother's cash cow,” and “Johansson eventually cut her off because Sloan was living outside her means.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She gave her mother a very generous severance package and continued to support her. In 2012, Sloan was caught up in some real estate issues but Johansson wouldn't bail her out “because she's fed up with her former mom-ager's extravagant lifestyle.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYDailynews</a>) However, they still remain close and Johansson even took her mother to the 2017 amfAR New York Gala.</p><h2 id=family-over-fame---jennifer-garner><strong>Family Over Fame - Jennifer Garner&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Garner</a> takes her work very seriously but has always put her family first. She's best known for portraying Sydney Bristow in the ABC series Alias. She went on to star in several popular films, including, 13 Going on 30, Juno and Dallas Buyers Club.</p><p>From 2005 to 2017, she was in a highly publicized relationship&nbsp;with actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a>. They became close while working on the films Pearl Harbor and Daredevil. They married in 2005 and have three kids. During their marriage, they took turns taking care of the children while the other focused on their career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Garner said, “I've never been away for more than, I think, four days. Maybe once I was gone from my kids for five days… I sit down at the beginning of the movie and say to the people making the schedule, ‘Let's look at this.’ Then I figure out where I'm going to take the kid and when I can get home.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USMagazine</a>)</strong></p><p>In 2017, Garner and Affleck’s divorce was finalized but they work together as co-parents. Garner still puts her family first before her fame. Affleck has also praised his ex-wife. He said, “Jen is a superhero mom. She is an amazing mother, and I'm really lucky to have her as a partner to co-parent these kids with.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!News</a>)</p><h2 id=dropped---nick-carter><strong>Dropped - Nick Carter</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Carter </a>first rose to fame as a member of the famous boy band, The Backstreet Boys. He has since embarked on a solo career. His younger brother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Carter</a>, also found a great deal of success. However, they both had their ups and downs throughout their careers. Their mother, Jane Carter, is accused of putting fame over her family. Jane began taking Nick to auditions at a very young age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Nick and Aaron were financially supporting their entire family since they were kids. However, they’ve both had problems with their parents over the years. Nick became fed up with being the family's only financial resource and is estranged from his mother. Additionally. Jane doesn’t approve of Nick’s wife Lauren Kitt.</p><p>Nick posted a message to Twitter, “Wish my mother would stop sending hurtful and hateful emails to me and my wife. Can’t people just be happy for me? Or leave me alone. #hurt.” A source close to Nick notes that he feels used by his family. The source said, “The family has always been after him. They’re always wanting something from Nick… money or support, or this and that. It’s never like, ‘We love you. We care about you.’ It’s always been like, ‘We need this and we need that.’” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar</a>)</p><h2 id=family-over-fame---jamie-lynn-spears><strong>Family Over Fame - Jamie Lynn Spears&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Lynn Spears</a> was poised to follow in her famous older sisters footsteps. However, she went in a completely different direction in life. Spears is the younger sister of pop icon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears.</a> From 2005 to 2008, Spears starred as Zoey Brooks in the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007, Spears shockingly announced her pregnancy and effectively took a hiatus from Hollywood. Her pregnancy created a great deal of controversy because she was only 16 at the time. Many in the media felt she was glamorizing teen pregnancy. However, she took responsibility for her actions and focused on her family. In 2008, her first daughter, Maddie, was born.</p><p><strong>She said, “I put myself in an adult situation, so I needed to handle it like an adult. My age was never an excuse for me — because, you know what, my daughter didn't ask for that.”</strong></p><p>In 2013, she launched a country music career but her family is still her number one priority. She said, “I brought this little girl into this world, and it's my job to make sure that she has the best life that she possibly can have — no one else's. You've got to take responsibility for your actions and that's what I try my best to do every single day.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>) In 2018, she gave birth to her second child, Ivey</p><h2 id=dropped---bill-hudson><strong>Dropped - Bill Hudson</strong></h2><p>Musician Bill Hudson rose to fame as a member of The Hudson Brothers. In 1976, Hudson married actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldie Hawn</a> and together they have two children, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate</a> and Oliver. Kate Hudson has become a famous Hollywood celeb in her own right. In 1980, Hudson and Hawn divorced and Hudson went back to his previous lifestyle. He essentially abandoned his wife and kids to focus on his career. Kate and Oliver's mother and her longtime significant other,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurt Russell</a>, raised them. In fact, Kate and Oliver consider Russell to be their father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>In 2015, Oliver sent out an Instagram pic with Bill and Kate on Father’s Day, which read, “Happy Abandonment Day.” Bill wasn’t pleased with the message.</strong></p><p>He responded, “I had five birth children but I now consider myself a father of three. I no longer recognize Oliver and Kate as my own.” He then asked them to stop using his last name. Kate decided to respond by sending love out to the man that helped raise her. She sent out a pic of her with Hawn and Russell. The caption read, “Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Father’s Day. I love you to the moon and back.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailymailUK</a>)</p><h2 id=family-over-fame---rick-moranis><strong>Family Over Fame - Rick Moranis&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In the 80’s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Moranis</a> was one of the top leading comedic actors. He starred in several classic 80’s comedies, such as Spaceballs, Ghostbusters, and Honey I Shrunk The Kids. However, he shockingly decided to completely step away from acting. He planned on only taking a short hiatus but it ended up lasting much longer. He said, “I was working with really interesting people, wonderful people. I went from that to being at home with a couple of little kids, which is a very different lifestyle. But it was important to me. I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever. My life is wonderful.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheList</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1997, his wife lost a long battle with&nbsp;a disease and Moranis dedicated his time to raising his two kids alone. He said, “The decision in my case to become a stay-at-home-dad, which people do all the time, I guess wouldn't have meant as much to people if I had a very simple kind of make-a-living existence … But because I came from celebrity and fame and what was the peak of a career, that was intriguing to people. To me, it wasn't that. It didn't have anything to do with that. It was work, and it was just time to make an adjustment.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uproxx</a>)</p><h2 id=dropped---macaulay-culkin><strong>Dropped - Macaulay Culkin&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Kit Culkin had dreams of making it big in showbiz. He had a brief career and mostly worked on Broadway. He never achieved his dreams of being a famous movie star. He's accused of using his children to achieve the fame and glory he never did. He became world famous for managing his famous children, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macaulay</a>, Rory and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieran Culkin</a>. Macaulay became a household name after starring in the massively popular Christmas classic, Home Alone and its sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. By his teenage years, Macaulay was worth around $50 million. He is regarded as one of the greatest child actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Macaulay said that his father often acted out aggressively towards the family. He also noted that his father was “jealous” of him and added, “‘Everything he tried to do in life, I excelled at before I was 10 years old.”</strong></p><p>Macaulay eventually fired his father as his manager and sued his parents for his earnings. They were removed as his guardians and he gained control over his fortune. He said, “I was like 'I’m done guys, hope you all made your money because there is no more coming from me.'” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MetroUK</a>)</p><h2 id=family-over-fame---demi-moore><strong>Family Over Fame - Demi Moore&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In the 90’s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Moore</a> was one of the highest paid Hollywood stars in the world. She starred in every major blockbuster film and was in major demand. In 1987, she married <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Willis</a> and they became the Hollywood “It” couple. They have three children together and divorced in 2000. She then married <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher</a> but they divorced in 2013. Despite becoming a major Hollywood star, Moore stepped away from Hollywood to focus on being a mom.&nbsp;During their marriage, Moore and Willis moved to Hailey, Idaho to live as normal as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>At the time Moore said, “One of my goals is to build a loving relationship so that my children, as adults, will want to share their lives with me. The foundation I lay — if it's not there now, it won't be later.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheList</a>)</strong></p><p>Her plan paid off and her children are very grateful for her scarifies. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumer Willis</a> considers herself and her sisters to “have been very, very blessed with not having stage parents.” She said, “because my mom had me when she was 25 and I'm 28 now and just to even imagine myself three years ago starting to have children and be married and have my career, it's pretty trippy and I'm so proud and kind of in awe of her.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>)</p><h2 id=dropped---tiger-woods><strong>Dropped - Tiger Woods&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>At one time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiger Woods</a> was the highest paid athlete in the world. He's widely regarded as one of the greatest pro golfers of all time. He had several major endorsement deals and was on top of the world. In 2003, he married a former model, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elin Nordegren</a>, and they have two kids. Woods had it all but that still wasn’t enough for him. The family life wasn’t as appealing as the celebrity lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, a large number of women came forward and claimed to have had a relationship with Woods. It turned into a major scandal that cost him several endorsement deals and brought about the end of his marriage. He also went on a career slump that has been difficult for him to get out of. He always tried to be a good father but was clearly not a very good husband. The scandals and controversy was a lot for the family to handle. Nordegren said, “I never suspected, not a one. For the last three-and-a-half years, when all this was going on, I was home a lot more with pregnancies, then the children and my school.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!News</a>) He has a much better relationship with his ex-wife and kids now. However, his career comeback is his main priority until he retires.</p><h2 id=family-over-fame---julia-roberts><strong>Family Over Fame - Julia Roberts&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There isn’t a person in the world that doesn’t know the name <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Roberts</a>. She was the Queen of Hollywood and starred in an endless line of classic films. Turns out that there are a few people that don’t know Roberts is a major star and those are her kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2002, Roberts married cameraman Daniel Moder and they now have three children. Roberts essentially disappeared from Hollywood after starting a family. She has been able to take her kids to places like Disneyland and not be bothered by staying off of social media. This prevents fans from knowing her every step.</p><p><strong>She said, “The strange culture of celebrity and the Internet age — I kind of am too old for that silly mess that goes on. I'm glad about that. It's helped that I'm definitely of a particular age.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USAToday</a>)</strong></p><p>She has done such a good job at separating her career and family that her kids are unaware she’s famous. She said, “It was on a crowded street, and somebody noticed me, and then another person noticed. Somebody said as we were walking past, ‘Oh, that's Julia Roberts.’ We all just kind of kept going, and then Finn said, '’Yeah, my mom's Julia Robinson.’ That's what gives you perspective. It could be Robinson, it could be Johnson, because it has nothing to do with me as a person.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheList</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dropped---floyd-mayweather-jr><strong>Dropped - Floyd Mayweather Jr.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Floyd Mayweather Jr. is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time. He's undefeated with a record of 50-0. He's known for fighting in several highly anticipated fights. He's also known for living up to his nickname “Money”.

He said, “I never stopped being on stage. What I did was step off of the main stage because those lights were hot, and I was trying to do other things with my life. That kind of attention wouldn't have been conducive to raising a family.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>) He has since made a return to the spotlight after releasing a series of Netflix stand up specials and hosting Saturday Night Live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dropped---kris-jenner><strong>Dropped - Kris Jenner</strong></h2><p>The Kardashian-Jenner clan is one of the most famous celebrity families.
