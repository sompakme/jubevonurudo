Over the course of <a href=#>American history</a>, there have been presidents who were already wealthy when they assumed office, and others who amassed great fortunes while in power. This article will take a closer look at the 10 richest US presidents of all time, examining their net worth, the sources of their wealth, and how they used their financial resources to shape their presidencies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bill-clinton---75-9-million>Bill Clinton - $75.9 Million</h2><p>Bill Clinton's net worth is estimated to be around $75.9 million, which he primarily earned after leaving office. His earnings came from various sources such as his 2005 autobiography "My Life" which brought him millions of dollars, as well as paid speeches and consulting work. His wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, also contributed to their combined net worth through her own earnings. Her 2014 memoir "Hard Choices" reportedly garnered her a $14 million advance. The Clintons have been known to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earn substantial sums</a> from their paid speeches, with some estimates suggesting that they have earned over $150 million in speaking fees since leaving the White House.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=herbert-hoover---83-million>Herbert Hoover - $83 Million</h2><p>Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States from 1929 to 1933, had a peak net worth of $83 million. Despite being orphaned as a child, he managed to become a self-made man through his hard work and perseverance. Hoover graduated from Stanford University and pursued a career as a mining engineer before transitioning into politics. He even authored a textbook on mining engineering and was the proud owner of numerous Burmese silver mines that significantly contributed to his wealth.</p><h2 id=lyndon-b-johnson---109-3-million>Lyndon B. Johnson - $109.3 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his presidency from 1963-1969, the 36th president, Lyndon Johnson, amassed a fortune of $109.3 million. Prior to meeting and marrying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Claudia "Lady Bird" Taylor</a>, who hailed from a wealthy Texas family, Johnson was a driven and industrious individual with limited financial means. Together, the couple owned a sizable amount of land (607 hectares or 1,500 acres) and livestock in Texas, but their primary source of income stemmed from Lady Bird's ownership of a radio station.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Richest Living Members Of Rothschild Family, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=james-madison---113-3-million>James Madison - $113.3 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James Madison, the 4th President of the United States from 1809-1817, reached a peak net worth of $113.3 million. Madison's parents were affluent and owned a significant amount of land, including the prosperous Montpelier estate in Orange County, Virginia. Despite his family's wealth, Madison faced financial difficulties later in life. His plantation was not as profitable as expected, and his stepson's drinking and gambling problems resulted in <a href=#>significant financial losses</a>. These factors contributed to Madison's financial struggles toward the end of his life.</p><h2 id=andrew-jackson---132-6-million>Andrew Jackson - $132.6 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States from 1829-1837, reached a peak net worth of $132.6 million. Unlike many of his predecessors, Jackson did not come from a wealthy background and had to earn his own income as a lawyer. However, despite his humble beginnings, Jackson's financial situation improved significantly when he married Rachel, who brought considerable wealth into the marriage. Jackson inherited a substantial fortune from Rachel following her death shortly before he assumed the presidency.</p><h2 id=theodore-roosevelt---139-7-million>Theodore Roosevelt - $139.7 Million</h2><p>Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States from 1901-1909, had a peak net worth of $139.7 million. Although he inherited a substantial trust fund, he didn't actively pursue <a href=#>methods to accumulate wealth</a>. Instead, he dedicated most of his adult life to public service, beginning with his election to the New York State Assembly at the young age of 23. Despite his commitment to public service, Roosevelt suffered a financial setback when a ranch investment in the Dakotas resulted in a significant loss of his fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thomas-jefferson---236-8-million>Thomas Jefferson - $236.8 Million</h2><p>Being the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809, Thomas Jefferson's net worth peaked at $236.8 million. He inherited 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) of land near Charlottesville, Virginia from his father and later acquired an additional 809 hectares (2,000 acres) of land to expand his <a href=#>real estate holdings</a>. Jefferson built his notable residence, Monticello, on this land. Although he remained wealthy for most of his life, Jefferson was in significant debt when he passed away. This was partly due to unreliable farming income, and also because Jefferson was a lavish spender who lived beyond his means.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Superheroes Ever, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=george-washington---587-million>George Washington - $587 Million</h2><p>George Washington, the first president of the United States who served from 1789 to 1797, had a peak net worth of $587 million. Most of his wealth was inherited, as he received his profitable plantation, Mount Vernon, from his half-brother. In addition, Washington earned a substantial income as a general and later as president. His presidential salary in 1789 was $25,000, which constituted 2% of the entire US budget.</p><h2 id=john-f-kennedy---1-1-billion>John F. Kennedy - $1.1 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his tenure as the 35th <a href=#>US president</a> from 1961 to 1963, John F. Kennedy's net worth reached a peak of $1.1 billion. Kennedy's wealth was entirely inherited, as he was born into a wealthy family. His father, Joe Kennedy, had amassed a fortune through banking and investments, making him one of the wealthiest people in the United States. Furthermore, Kennedy's wife, Jackie, was also affluent, being an oil heiress.</p><h2 id=donald-j-trump---3-1-billion>Donald J. Trump - $3.1 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donald Trump's net worth has peaked at $3.1 billion. He assumed office as the 45th president in 2017. The New York Times reports that he was born into wealth and inherited at least $413 million from his father. Trump's wealth further increased when he took over his father's real estate business, and he now possesses billions of dollars in real estate. However, during his presidency, <a href=#>Trump faced controversy</a> and scrutiny over his financial dealings, including conflicts of interest related to his businesses and his refusal to release his tax returns.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>A Peek Inside The Lavish Lifestyle of Dubai's Ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VOA News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Motley Fool</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmqpmYtaa%2F02asrGWgp7K0tcOepa2rXaSzbq3LpWStoZ2aerOtzaScnWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./david-drummond-net-worth-how-much-is-david-drummond-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;David Drummond Net Worth How Much Is David Drummond Worth?</a>
