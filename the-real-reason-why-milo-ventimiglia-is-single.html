There's no denying that this actor is totally handsome and since he doesn't talk much about his personal life, there's always an air of mystery around him. Milo is always kind, friendly, and polite in interviews. And over the course of his acting career, he's picked some interesting parts, including Peter on Heroes and Sean on The Whispers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those of us who remember watching Jess and Rory fall deeply in love can't help but be interested in Milo Ventimiglia's love life. There's just something special about him that makes us hope that he finds love IRL. But even though the actor has had many famous partners over the years, he's still single. Keep reading to find out the real reason why Milo Ventimiglia is still single.</p><h2 id=milo-ventimiglia-is-all-about-his-acting-and-not-romance>Milo Ventimiglia Is All About His Acting And Not Romance</h2><p><a href=#>Milo Ventimiglia almost wasn't cast on This Is Us</a>, which is pretty wild to think about. There's a lot to love about this dramatic series, but most of all, we enjoy seeing Milo's acting talents as Jack Pearson, a family man with a tragic life.</p><p>According to Cheat Sheet, Milo Ventimiglia said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Haute Living</a> that he makes acting his priority and that can be difficult on romantic and platonic relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Milo said, “Everything is second position to work — everything." The actor continued that in the past, when he has been in a relationship, he hasn't had much time to hang out with that special person. Milo said of his acting jobs, "You kind of have to dedicate yourself to it in a greater way, and some things are going to be sacrificed while others can run concurrently.”</p><p>Sometimes people feel that they have to devote all of their time and energy to building their career or attending college or graduate school, so Milo's words are definitely relatable. We're so used to seeing celebrities dating a lot or entering new relationships soon after one ends, so this is something new and refreshing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Milo explained, "I’d get home from work and a girlfriend would want to spend time together, and I’d have to make sure I did spend time with her, sit down and eat, maybe turn on a movie for 20 minutes." Milo continued that once he ate dinner, he would be running lines for another few hours and that he never wanted to "waste time" on set since the crew works so hard."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Instagram Hopes That Gilmore Girls' Jess Finally Gets His Deserved Ending After Milo Ventimiglia Spotted Filming</a></span></p><h2 id=milo-ventimiglia-39-s-relationship-with-kelly-egarian>Milo Ventimiglia's Relationship With Kelly Egarian</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, people thought that Milo Ventimiglia was dating Kelly Egarian as, according to People, they attended the Emmy Awards together. Milo doesn't like to talk about his romantic life and when this topic is brought up, he sounds super humble. While he totally gets that people are always interested in learning more about their favorite celebrities, he sees himself as a normal person.</p><p>Milo said that he likes to be "as anonymous and invisible as I can" so that people focus on the characters he portrays instead of his personal life. He said, "I don’t know how interesting my life is any more than anyone else’s. I got to feed myself, I got to get to the gym, I have family, I have close friends and loved ones.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Milo Ventimiglia Wanted Jess On 'Gilmore Girls' To Be Hit By A Bus</a></span></p><h2></h2><h2 id=milo-ventimiglia-dated-hayden-panettiere-and-alexis-bledel>Milo Ventimiglia Dated Hayden Panettiere And Alexis Bledel</h2><p>While Milo Ventimiglia may be single now, he dated two women who he starred on popular TV shows with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dated while starring on Heroes</a>.
