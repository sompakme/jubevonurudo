They continued, "Two individuals were aggressively pushing their way towards Taylor, grabbing at her security personnel, and threatening to throw a female staff member into the water."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In response to the statement</a>, McDonald claimed it was "utter rubbish," adding, "This is the sort of bulls*** I might expect. Which female was that? The only one there was Taylor." He claims that Scott "charged" at him. "She got off the boat, she walked towards security guards who were shoving umbrellas in our faces, and then he charged," McDonald said of the events. Footage obtained by Daily Mail Australia reveals more about the events that took place, including a security guard telling McDonald not to touch the umbrellas that Swift and her father were using to shield themselves from the paparazzi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scott can also be seen showing the cameras his middle finger. <strong>McDonald told the outlet that his alleged actions did not show him being aggressive</strong>. According to Daily Mail Australia, he also claimed to be "shocked when he realized the alleged attacker was the pop star's dad."</p><p><strong>The New South Wales police department launched an investigation. Then, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024, the police released a statement about their findings.</strong> They claimed officers "conducted an investigation following a report of an assault. No further police action," will be taken, RTE reports.</p><h2 id=what-has-taylor-swift-said-about-her-eras-tour>What Has Taylor Swift Said About Her Eras Tour?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-and-her-parents-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Taylor Swift is likely relieved that the allegations against her father have been dismissed, and the case will not go further.
