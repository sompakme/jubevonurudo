I can't explain it — it's just a feeling."</p><p>The identity of Montero's mystery man turned out to be his backup dancer Yai Ariza, <a href=#>who he kissed on stage at the BET Awards</a> that same year.

I've been wanting somebody for so long and wanting somebody to love for so long, but it's a real responsibility," Montero said. "And you have to give this person your time. And I like to go missing for like a week to focus … not talk to anyone and focus on myself.
