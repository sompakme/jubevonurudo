then reduced the asking price to $12.5 million in October 2022.The couple is trading the 11,000 square feet Mediterranean-style villa for their Buckinghamshire House that rests on an acre of land about an hour outside of London. This 5,680-square-foot includes five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms.The Osbournes purchased the Buckinghamshire House––officially called Welders––back in 1993.
