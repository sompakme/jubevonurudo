At that time, Cabello was still with Fifth Harmony who was then opening for Austin Mahone.</p><p>Speaking about her first impression of Mendes, the songstress told V Magazine back then: "I remember I wanted to hang out with you, but you were always on the tour bus, just learning guitar."</p><p>The Canadian heartthrob revealed that Cabello was the only one who reached out to him at that time. "Yeah, that was me. I didn't talk to anybody," he recalled. "You were the only person that talked to me."</p><p>He continued: "Like, you were the only one of everybody on that tour who would say words to me. Actually, I think if we go into our DMs or something, there's a photo from the day we met, I think."</p><p>They went on to make <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> collaborations in the following years, including 2015's I Know What You Did Last Summer and 2019's steamy bop Señorita, which fueled the intense paparazzi coverage of their PDAs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By November 2020, the couple had adopted a puppy together during quarantine.

"Hey guys, we've decided to end our romantic relationship but our love for one another is stronger than ever," they wrote in their joint statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We started our relationship as best friends and will continue to be best friends," they added. "We so appreciate your support from the beginning and moving forward."</p><p>A source also told ET that it was Mendes who initiated the difficult conversation, saying that they're "still in communication and want to be friends" but that "the relationship was getting stale and complacent and they decided they are better off being friends."</p><p>Two months later, the couple was spotted walking their dog together in Miami. Each went on to release breakup singles (no pun intended) which bore speculations about them possibly getting back together.</p><p>True enough, <a href=#>Cabello and Mendes were spotted making out at Coachella</a> in April 2023. It was followed by several other public sightings including dates at a comedy club and a coffee shop. They were also "cuddly" at <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>'s Eras Tour the following month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But just seven days after news of them "practically moving in together in June, news broke that this time, Cabello initiated the move to part ways for good. "Shawn and Camila have a lot of history and they tested the waters again after coming back into each other's lives, but it was just a fling and they've put an end to it now," an insider told The Sun back then.</p><p>"They realized it was probably a mistake to give things another shot," they continued. "Things ended between them the first time for a reason, after all." Soon, the two were back to seeing other people. Cabello was linked to dating app founder, Austin Kevitch within two weeks of the breakup.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Camila Cabello Turned Down A Major Collaboration And It Was All Because Of Fifth Harmony</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-shawn-mendes-dating-now>Who Is Shawn Mendes Dating Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/shawn-mendes-2.jpg><p>Somewhere between Mendes' on-and-off romance with Cabello, <a href=#>he started seeing Sabrina Carpenter</a>. It was back in March 2023, a month before he was seen kissing Cabello at Coachella. In an article published on March 2013, a source told ET Online: "Shawn and Sabrina are seeing each other."</p><p>They added that "they have been hanging out a lot and trying to keep things low-key" and that "they were at a birthday party together a couple weeks ago and were cute together." The insider also noted, "Shawn is happy."</p><p>In a recent Deuxmoi blind item with the clever subject, "New señorita," a tipster with the pseudonym, Toronto Nights claimed that Mendes had been "on several dates with a blonde normie since he's back home the last few weeks."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She is a [Toronto-based] lawyer," they noted. "His close friends seem to love her!" While some fans expressed their excitement for the former Vine star, a Redditor wrote that "this blind is completely fake and made up by Camila stans, they've been harassing Shawn for the past 2 months."</p><p>We'll never know until Mendes confirms it himself. In the meantime, it's worth noting that he's been the subject of several false stories, including those "frustrating" gay rumors that started when he was just 15.</p><p>"It was so, so frustrating for me because there were some people in my life that I was very, very close to who were gay and in the closet," he told Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast in 2020. "And I felt this real anger for those people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoZmno3qusc2dnKxlk6S6sbjInJitnZRiubDCxGajop6VYq6nwMSrZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2strW0jJyYpqGcoa5ur8CbnKWkn2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./taylor-swift-receives-birthday-gift-from-kansas-city-chiefs-owner.html>&#171;&nbsp;Taylor Swift Receives Birthday Gift From Kansas City Chiefs Owner</a>
