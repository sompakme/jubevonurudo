With an enormous amount of money, it is not surprising that he owns <a href=#>million dollar worth of cars </a>in the exquisite collection. His car collection contains the most exquisite cars in the world. In fact, his cars are dominated by huge one-off creations. He has a massive collection of over 200 cars that includes classic American cars, off-road vehicles, 1885 steam-powered Mercedes and even the world’s largest truck</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the big gigantic custom made cars that the Sheikh owns, he also owns normal cars. He is known to be a massive fan of Mercedes-Benz and his collection is abundant with classic S-Class models. Most of the normal cars in his collection are custom made with gold and rainbow colored accents. However he allegedly does not own any cars from the luxury car manufacturers BMW and Audi. Take a peek at the normal cars the Sheik owns.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="A Peek Inside Rick Ross’ Exquisite Car Collection" href=#>A Peek Inside Rick Ross’ Exquisite Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=fiat-500>Fiat 500</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For some who has spent his lifetime accumulating hundreds of exquisite and unconventional automotive creations, it’s a little surprising that the billionaire owns Fiat 500 in his collection. Although Fiat 500 may not scream luxury, it is a reliable car on the road. Fiat 500 would be a great car if one needs to make quick trips or run an errand.</p><p>However, this is a not the best car to use for a long distance drive. The suggested retail price for a Fiat 500 is around $17,750.</p><h2 id=first-generation-porsche-boxster-porsche-986>First Generation Porsche Boxster: Porsche 986</h2><p>The multibillionaire may own hundreds of automobiles; however, he does not own a single supercar in his collection. His car collection is displayed at four different museums and it is surprising to see that his massive car collection doesn’t have a supercar. The closest thing to a sporty car in his lavish car collection is the first generation Porsche Boxster, Porsche 986.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>exquisite cars from Porsche</a> is typically included in most of celebrities' car collection. The Porsche 986 is not as expensive as one would expect since it is considered to be the least expensive a flat-six powered sports car. The car only costs less than $20,000.</p><h2 id=the-world-s-largest-running-jeep>The World’s Largest Running Jeep</h2><p>The Sheikh’s car collection includes normal cars, but most of them are rare and custom made to be a gigantic piece. One of the most impressive cars in his collection is a towering replica of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World War II-era Willys Jeep</a>. The said jeep is about 21 foot and it was so big that it was even named by the Guinness World Records as the world’s largest motorized car in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is not much information about the car since the details on it were never publicly published. However, it was revealed that the largest Jeep is being powered by a relatively tiny engine which can be found behind the grille. There is no information on the exact costs of the gigantic jeep costs, however it was reported that each earthmover tires alone can run up to $40,000 each.</p><h2 id=dhabiyan-the-world-s-biggest-suv>Dhabiyan: The World’s Biggest SUV</h2><p>Aside from owning the record holder World War II-era Willys Jeep in his collection, Sheikh Hamad’s collection is also the home of the world’s biggest SUV. Dhabiyan is a 10 wheeler car that is 10.8 meters long, 2.5 meters wide and about 3 meters tall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The car is so massive that when placed side by side with the Ford F-150, the 4x4 truck would look like a toy car. The cost of the supersized SUV was not disclosed publicly but it surely costs a fortune.</p><h2 id=1950s-dodge-power-wagon>1950s Dodge Power Wagon</h2><p>The Rainbow Sheikh also owns a 1950s Dodge Power Wagon in his collection. However, it is not your typical 1950s Dodge Power Wagon since the one he owns is the supersized replica of the Wagon that is about 64 times the normal size. The massive truck is comparable to a rolling luxury villa that contains four large air-conditioned bedrooms with bathrooms complete with a living room and even has a patio. The <a href=#>Wagon that contains rooms</a> can house a large number of people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The price for the said car was not disclosed, however, a typical 1950s Dodge Power Wagon costs around $92,000 each. Imagine the car costing 64 times than the normal price.</p><h2 id=gigantic-hummer-h1>Gigantic Hummer H1</h2><p>Gearheads would never in a million years call a typical Hummer H1 a small sized car. However, when placed side by side with Sheikh Hamad’s supersized Hummer H1, one will surely comment on how small the Hummer H1 is. The enormous version of the Hummer H1 was so big that it was awarded the world record for the largest Hummer in the world.</p><p>The Hummer H1 in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainbow Sheikh’s car collection </a>is about three times the normal size in terms of scale and is about 27 times larger than volume. A typical Hummer H1 costs around $113,000, so the large Hummer H1 version in Sheikh’s collection might be three times the price of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=double-jeep-wrangler>Double Jeep Wrangler</h2><p>As if owning the largest running Jeep is not enough, <a href=#>the passionate Rainbow Sheikh</a> decided to add more jeep in his collection, this time it’s a double sized Jeep Wrangler. The Sheikh has always been fond of upscaling his vehicle and this time, he doubled his Jeep Wrangler.</p><p>The said car pretty much take ups a massive space in the road and driving it on the road might be a little over the top. A typical Jeep Wrangler costs around $30,000, so a double sized one may double the costs as well.</p><h2 id=extremely-supercharged-lamborghini>Extremely Supercharged Lamborghini</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Owning a Lamborghini is in itself a luxury, however, taking it up a notch with adding more into the typical car is a little extreme. With the entire collection of Rainbow Sheikh, it is not surprising that he likes his cars a little over the top. This is not the most bizarre car in his collection but this probably one of the cars that will makes you wonder why. The estimated price for the supercharged Lamborghini is about $100,000.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The 958 Garage: A Peek Inside Usain Bolt's Car Collection" href=#>The 958 Garage: A Peek Inside Usain Bolt's Car Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Road And Track</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Car Blondie</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmp56dm2K2r7%2FInZxmrJiaeq6t0qygr51dmK6zecKoo6Wdk6m2sLqMqJ1mrJiaerOtyKeZqK9dqLWmtcqhZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./here-are-17-minutes-of-parks-and-rec-bloopers-to-improve-your-next-17-minutes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here are 17 Minutes of Parks and Rec Bloopers to Improve Your Next 17 Minutes</a>
