In 1985, he was cast as a new and younger cast member on Saturday Night Live (SNL). However, the show had low ratings, and his comedic abilities were questioned. Eventually, he was removed and replaced. In the same year, he made his dramatic acting breakthrough by portraying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Spader's sidekick in Tuff Turf</a> and subsequently a bully in John Hughes' Weird Science. He was even considered for the role of Duckie in Pretty in Pink by John Hughes.

He was arrested multiple times on drug-related offenses, including cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. While driving along Sunset Boulevard in April 1996, he was caught for possession of heroin, cocaine, and an unloaded.357 Magnum handgun. Later, he was compelled to undergo mandatory drug testing.

August 2001 marked his first acting role following recovery. The video for Elton John's hit "I Want Love" features lip-syncing. Despite his extensive critical acclaim throughout his career, he did not have any blockbuster pictures. In 2008, everything changed. Iron Man and Tropic Thunder were both critically and commercially successful films starring Robert Downey Jr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iron Man director John Favreau urged that Robert Downey Jr. perform the role. As he desired him to be a franchise-carrying lead actor, comparable to Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, he compared him to Johnny Depp. To look the part, he had to grow more than 20 pounds of muscle in five months.
