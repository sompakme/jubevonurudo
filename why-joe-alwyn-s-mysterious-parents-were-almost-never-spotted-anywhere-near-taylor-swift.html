This is evident in her highly publicized relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce and her past relationships. When <strong>Swift dated <a href=#>Joe Alwyn</a></strong>, their relationship was pretty much private, with only a few moments of their public appearances and insider information getting out. Part of the details of their relationship was how the "Folklore" crooner and the Young Margaret actor's families approved of their love life.</p><p>Despite the news that their families adored their relationship, fans could not help but notice that the <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>icon was <strong>barely photographed with Joe Alwyn's parents</strong>. Notably, during the former couple's relationship, they adopted an ultra-private love life, which might have extended to their relationship with their parents. The songstress, whose <strong>11th studio album "The Tortured Poets Department" is believed to be inspired by Alwyn</strong>, dated him for six years. In this article, we will examine why Alwyn's mom and dad were barely spotted with Swift throughout their relationship.
