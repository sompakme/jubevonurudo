He&nbsp;started eBay on his living room couch. Now, the business is one of the largest marketplaces on Earth, helping to develop a fledgling e-commerce market into a worldwide behemoth in the span of 20 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, eBay is responsible for billions of dollars of transactions every year, ranging from mundane collectibles to high value consumer goods that satisfy the desires of the well-heeled. Some of the auctions that take place on eBay involve sales of the strange and wacky, such as an auction for ownership of another person's life.</p><p>It didn't take long for eBay to become big enough to host the sales of truly elite items, gathering bids in the millions of dollars. The ubiquity of eBay on the internet connected all the way to the most wealthy, who have thrown millions at incredible one-of-a-kind items that can't be found anywhere else.&nbsp;The following 15 eBay auctions are the most expensive items sold or listed on the website, ranging from antique collectibles to advanced military hardware capable of destroying entire city blocks with a flick of&nbsp;the&nbsp;wrist.</p><h2 id=honus-wagner---1-265-million>15. Honus Wagner - $1.265 million</h2><p>businessinsider.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Honus Wagner was one of the original greats of baseball, lauded for his amazing hitting and fielding skills. A cigarette company decided to issue a series of cards in 1909, including his image inside packs of cigarettes. He objected to being included in the series without his permission, resulting in most of his cards being pulled from the collection.</p><p>Due to this recall, the 1909 Honus Wagner became a <a href=#>rare commodity</a>, resulting in a huge&nbsp;eBay sale of nearly $1.27 million - $1.1 million for the card plus a 15 percent buyer's fee. This was a record amount for a baseball card in 2000.</p><p></p><h2 id=world-s-largest-lunchbox-collection---1-7-million>14.

Atlas F Missile Base - $2.1 million</h2><p>refinedguy.com</p><p>This relic of the cold war was built to survive any nuke that's tossed at it. Located in the Adirondack State Park in the state of New York, this former missile base is located close to Lower Saranac Lake, where Mark Twain sometimes spent his summers. Prior to its listing on eBay, the Atlas F missile base used to contain missiles that could devastate targets thousands of miles away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to fetch a better price for this rare type of property, the sellers focused on the fact that the base is the perfect solution considering the "escalating threat of world terrorism and an increasing need for security." The property was sold to an anonymous couple for $2.1 million in 2002.</p><p></p><h2 id=the-farm---2-4-million>12. The Farm - $2.4 million</h2><p>The Atlas F Missile base isn't the only interesting luxury property listed on eBay.

After purchasing the town in 2004 on eBay, he pumped about half-a-million dollars into his&nbsp;new&nbsp;investment to make it more attractive to potential buyers.</p><p>Three years later, he put Albert up for auction on eBay again. This time, the bids ended up landing in the millions. The new owner won the auction for $2.5 million, netting Bobby more than a million dollars in profit.</p><p></p><h2 id=lunch-with-warren-buffet---2-63-million>10. Lunch With Warren Buffet - $2.63 million</h2><p>One of the richest men in the world is also one of the biggest philanthropists as well, raising ridiculous amounts of money for charitable causes as he rakes in the money with Berkshire Hathaway.

Originally, this comic sold for ten pennies in 1938.</p><p>Now that Superman is perhaps the most recognizable superhero on the planet, the fact that about 100 copies of this historic comic exist has driven its price up to a whopping $3.2 million dollars on an eBay auction with a starting bid of 99 cents.</p><p></p><h2 id=shane-butcher-s-life---3-5-million>7.

Crypt Above Marilyn Monroe's Resting Place - $4.6 million</h2><p>via:melindamason.wordpress.com</p><p>Sometimes, eBay auctions involve the sale of items that are dubious to both buy and sell. In the case of the space above <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe's</a> grave, both the buyer and the seller appear to have slightly strange and dubious motives.</p><p>With a minimum starting bid of $500,000, Elsie Poncher put her husband's crypt up for auction, which had developed quite a cache due to its location above the final resting place of Marilyn Monroe. Bidding ended up ballooning all the way up to $4.6 million, taking care of the capital she needed to continue her life in Beverly Hills. To this day no one&nbsp;knows why the buyer valued the crypt at the price of a luxury home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=gulfstream-ii-private-jet---4-9-million>5.

Space Monkey Sam Photo - $5 million</h2><p>investopedia.com</p><p>One of the stranger high-value auctions on eBay is a simple photograph. Space Monkey Sam was one of the first monkeys to be shot out into space, flying 55 miles into the sky on December 4th, 1959. Unlike many of the poor subjects of these space flight experiments, Space Monkey Sam actually made it back alive, becoming a bit of a celebrity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The photo of Space Monkey Sam being auctioned is signed by the paw of the brave primate himself and arrives with a certificate of authenticity backed up by the U.S. Air Force.

This dual portrait features Elvis in color and James Dean in black and white.</p><p>Two different bids for $7 million were proposed through eBay, but neither of them were approved, resulting in another wait to see who is willing to pony up $7 million for the portrait.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=navy-f-a-18a-hornet---10-05-million>2.

Those who wish to bid on the finest in military aircraft in the world also have their own auctions. In 2004, the United States Navy's F/A-18 Hornet fighter was listed on eBay.</p><p>The starting bid was $1.05 million - much less than the original cost of $29 million that the government paid for this supersonic jet.
