She is the daughter of Michelle and Brian Wilson, and she has an older sister named Janna. During Lainey’s youth, Michelle worked as a schoolteacher, and Brian was a farmer. Wilson’s family listened to country music by artists such as Glen Campbell and Buck Owens, and in a 2021 interview with “The Advocate,” Lainey stated, “Country music for me and my family, it was more than music. We lived the words to those songs.” Wilson grew up on a farm in a town with just 250 people. When she was 9 years old, she went to a performance at the Grand Ole Opry and was inspired to start writing songs and learning to play guitar. In 2006, Wilson released the EP “Country Girls Rule” on MySpace. As a teenager, she worked as a Hannah Montana impersonator, performing at birthday parties, festivals, and fairs in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Lainey once performed at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital for children suffering from cancer.</p><h2 id=career><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After graduating from high school, Wilson moved to Nashville during the summer of 2011.

Her follow-up, “Tougher,” was released on Lone Chief Records in 2016, and it reached #44 on the “Billboard” Top Country Albums chart.

In October 2022, Lainey told “Taste of Country,” “He spent two months in a hospital from a fungal infection that completely took out the left side of his face. They had to remove his eye and they had to remove some bones in face. He had a stroke on top of all of that. He had nine surgeries in a month and a half. He’s not supposed to be here.” Brian eventually recovered and accompanied Lainey to the Country Music Association Awards in November 2022.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-and-nominations></span><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wilson earned two nominations for the 2024 Grammy Awards: Best Country Album for “Bell Bottom Country” and Best Country Duo/Group Performance for “Save Me” (shared with Jelly Roll).
