If you said a bad hockey player, you are correct.</p><p>This list is pretty straightforward. I will admit, it is tough to have to call these guys the "worst" hockey players ever, but simply a necessary reality of sports writing. It is true that sometimes NHL teams are forced to compile their teams with some borderline NHL caliber talent. It might not have been apparent that these players were so horrible when they were either first drafted or picked up in the free agency, but it became apparent after they had a chance to actually prove they're worth—which they could not do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Realistically, teams need roster-fillers But where are these players now? Have some of these players fell off the map? Lost a bunch of money? Or have some of the former players turned to a different life, a more successful endeavor?</p><p>Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=gord-kluzak><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Gord Kluzak</span></h2><p>Kluzak was the first overall pick in the 1982 NHL Draft by the Boston Bruins. He was a top prospect. Gord was supposed to be a skilled defenseman, but he failed to live up&nbsp;any expectations. Injuries plagued his career, like many draft disappointments. The rest is history, and he played nine dreaded seasons with the Bruins.</p><p>Today, Gord is a managing director at Goldman Sachs. After the NHL, he enrolled in Harvard and majored in Economics. He then went to Harvard Business School.</p><h2 id=doug-berry><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Doug Berry</span></h2><p>Berry had an extremely short hockey career. Drafted out of British Columbia, Doug had some hype surrounding him. He was the 38th overall selection in the 1977 NHL Draft by the Colorado Rockies. Doug ended up playing overseas in Germany, and did better there but was very bad in the NHL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Doug coaches youth hockey. He recently coached the Manitowoc Breaker Pee Wees.</p><h2 id=andre-racicot><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Andre Racicot</span></h2><p>"Red Light" was drafted 83rd in the 1989 NHL Draft by the Canadiens. He had a pretty long career, playing from 1989-2004.&nbsp; He was usually always a backup goalie, and never really progressed much in the NHL. He was nicknamed Red Light due to red light to signal a goal always coming on when he was in nets.</p><p>Andre lives in Ste-Agathe-des-Monts in the Laurentians. He works modestly for a gold mine at a company called Agnico-Eagle.</p><h2 id=patrik-stefan><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Patrik Stefan</span></h2><p>Stefan was the first pick in the 1999 NHL Draft by the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. He played from 1996-2007 -- a career that was very forgettable. He scored 177 points in six seasons with the Thrashers and floated out to the minors after being released.</p><p>Stefan is a hockey agent and is located in Laguna Beach, California. He coaches hockey at the Orange County Ice Palace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brett-lindros><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Brett Lindros</span></h2><p>Because of his star brother Eric, there were hopes Brett would amount to the same success. Wrong. Lindros retired two years after being drafted ninth overall in '94 because of concussions. He was picked by the Islanders and only played 51 games for them. Lindros only scored twice.</p><p>Today, Lindros struggles with his post-concussion syndrome. In 2001, he was hurt very badly in a snowmobile accident. Lindros was still charged with operating a snowmobile without a permit.</p><h2 id=jay-caufield><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Jay Caufield</span></h2><p>The Philadelphia native went undrafted and played right wing for the Penguins, North Stars, and Rangers. Caufield had 273 penalty minutes in the short span of 65 games. He had but five goals in 208 games his entire career.</p><p>Today, Jay does a couple of different things. He was in a movie entitled, Sudden Death, where he played a hockey goalie named Brad Tolliver. Jay has worked as a personal trainer and works on <i>Root Sports Live: Penguins Post Game </i>as an analyst</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alek-stojanov><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Alek Stojanov</span></h2><p>It is ridiculous that Alek Stojanov was the seventh pick in the 1991 entry draft. He is easily regarded as one of hockey's biggest busts ever. Stojanov never cemented himself as a consistent player, either getting injured or failing to maximize his opportunities on the ice. He had a minus-12 rating by the time his career ended.</p><p>Today?</p><p>Today, Stojanov is almost non-existent in the media. Little to nothing is known of his whereabouts. Maybe he is prepping for doomsday? Keeping lowkey?</p><h2 id=jason-bonsignore><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Jason Bonsignore</span></h2><p>Jason Bonsignore got selected fourth overall in the '94 entry draft by the Oilers.&nbsp; Bonsignore played just 20 games for the Oilers and had two points. Fortunately, the Oilers also nabbed Ryan Smyth in this draft, saving them some face.</p><p>He went on to race in speedway and has had some success in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alexander-svitov><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Alexander Svitov</span></h2><p>Talk about a bust. Alexander Svitov was the worst Lightning selection EVER. He recorded eight points in his rookie year, got traded to the Blue Jackets and the rest is history. He then returned to Russia after it was obvious his career in the NHL had amounted to nothing.</p><p>He most recently played for the AK Bars Kazan in KHL. Afterward, he retired from hockey and has been keeping it lowkey.</p><h2 id=ken-mcauley><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Ken McAuley</span></h2><p>The Alberta native played two dreadful seasons from 1943-1945. His total was 17 wins in 96 games before he was shipped off to the Senior Hockey League in Western Canada. He is most known for surrendering eight goals in one period alone in 1943.</p><h2 id=bill-mickelson><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Bill Mickelson</span></h2><p>Phil's brother (just kidding) is known for his plus/minus record of minus-82 for the Capitals from 1974 to '75. This record still stands. He retired in 1977 as one of the worst players to ever play professional hockey, along with a staggering number of only five goals and 18 assists during his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Bill is a mentor for his son Brendan. Brendan was the 31st overall pick in the 2005 draft but now plays in Sweden for Luleå HF of the Swedish Hockey League. Additionally, Bill's daughter Meaghan won a gold medal with Team Canada in 2010 and 2014.</p><h2 id=jack-lynch><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jack Lynch</span></h2><p>Lynch had a minus-15 after 50 games for the Capitals in 1975. In 382 games played, he had a minus-197 total. Considering that he was the 24th overall pick in the draft, needless to say, the organization was furious.</p><p>Today, Jack resides in Toronto with his wife and kids. He teaches hockey at a youth center, as well as a High School team.</p><h2 id=rick-jodzio><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rick Jodzio</span></h2><p>Rick played&nbsp;one&nbsp;season in 1978. He played for the Colorado Rockies and the Cleveland Barons. Afterward, he bounced around in minor leagues. In 1976, Rick put Marc Tardiff on a stretcher in a WHA playoff game. He scored two goals and had 71 penalty minutes in 70 games.</p><p>Rick pursued boxing after hockey. Today, he is the owner of Frontline Freight—a trucking company in California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gary-laskowski><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gary Laskowski</span></h2><p>The Los Angeles Kings signed Gary in 1982 to be their starting goalie. He managed a record of 15 wins, 20 losses, and one tie. He had a GAA of 4.56 and a .857 save percentage.</p><p>Today, Gary sells insurance at <a href=#>State Farm.</a> He lives in Lakewood, Colorado.</p><h2 id=paul-higgins><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Paul Higgins</span></h2><p>The Leafs drafted Higgins with the 200th overall selection in 1981. They took him right out of Henry Carr High School. He played three games that season and had 17 penalty minutes. The following season, he racked up 135 penalty minutes and played 22 games.</p><p>He was <a href=#>arrested </a>in 1984 for "dangerous driving and possession of a dangerous weapon." Today, he is more lowkey and lives with his family in Edmonton.</p><h2 id=john-scott><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>John Scott</span></h2><p>His career began in 2006, and his first game in Canada was a bust. He couldn't play in Toronto because he didn't have his passport. Whoops. In 2010, he was eventually released because of his worse than mediocre play. His career then went on a journey involving many teams. Scott had 517 penalty minutes by the time he last played in the NHL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, he is retired. He wrote an article entitled "Five Goals, Four Kids, One Hell of a Time," before retirement.</p><h2 id=ryan-hollweg><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ryan Hollweg</span></h2><p>Ryan Hollweg had supposed potential working in his favor when he entered the league. Eh, scratch that. Ryan had literally five goals in 228 games playing in the NHL.</p><p>Ryan played his last hockey in the Czech Extraliga for HC Skoda Plzen. In the 2015-16 season, he played 24 games and had 2 points. Today, he is retired and living in Toronto.</p><h2 id=frazer-mclaren><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Frazer McLaren</span></h2><p>Frazer McLaren was selected 207th in the 2007 NHL entry draft. He played for the Worcester Sharks and had 181 penalty minutes. He then got to play for the San Jose Sharks in 2009, making his NHL debut. He only scored one time in 23 games with the Sharks.</p><p>Frazer is now an unrestricted free agent. In 2015, he signed a one-year deal with the Sharks but was quickly sent down to the minors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hardy-astrom><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Hardy Astrom</span></h2><p>Hardy played three seasons in the NHL. The undrafted Swedish-born goalie struggled significantly in the box. He wasn't recognized as remotely productive. Don Cherry even nicknamed him "The Swedish Sieve" because he struggled so much in the crease.</p><p>Today, Astrom is the subject of a lot of hate on the internet, but comedy too. His whereabouts are unknown but if he Googles his own name, he will not be pleased by what he sees.</p><h2 id=andre-deveaux><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Andre Deveaux</span></h2><p>The 182nd pick in the 2002 draft didn't play until 2008 (with Toronto). He was unproductive in Toronto and actually went to the Rangers. Notably, he had 104 penalty minutes in his career and only two assists. He played 31 games in the NHL, had zero goals and three assists.</p><p>Deveaux's latest hockey action was with the Rögle BK in the second tier of the Swedish hockey league. He made waves in 2015 when he attacked Per Helmersson of the VIK Västerås HK from behind during warmups. As a result of the incident, Rögle terminated his contract and Deveaux hasn't been signed by a team since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuqKqjqXqxuMCynKurXZ67brrHpWShoaOpvLPFjLCfnqqVYq6zsYytn56xXaO8uHs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-chip-and-joanna-gaines-were-accused-of-being-hateful-and-if-the-accusations-were-legitimate.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Chip And Joanna Gaines Were Accused Of Being 'Hateful' And If The Accusations Were Legitimate</a>
